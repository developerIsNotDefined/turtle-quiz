});\n}\n/**\n * `ui-sref`: A directive for linking to a state\n *\n * A directive which links to a state (and optionally, parameters).\n * When clicked, this directive activates the linked state with the supplied parameter values.\n *\n * ### Linked State\n * The attribute value of the `ui-sref` is the name of the state to link to.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * This will activate the `home` state when the link is clicked.\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Relative Links\n * You can also use relative state paths within `ui-sref`, just like a relative path passed to `$state.go()` ([[StateService.go]]).\n * You just need to be aware that the path is relative to the state that *created* the link.\n * This allows a state to create a relative `ui-sref` which always targets the same destination.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Both these links are relative to the parent state, even when a child state is currently active.\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\".child1\">child 1 state</a>\n * <a ui-sref=\".child2\">child 2 state</a>\n * ```\n *\n * This link activates the parent state.\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"^\">Return</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### hrefs\n * If the linked state has a URL, the directive will automatically generate and\n * update the `href` attribute (using the [[StateService.href]]  method).\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Assuming the `users` state has a url of `/users/`\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"users\" href=\"/users/\">Users</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Parameter Values\n * In addition to the state name, a `ui-sref` can include parameter values which are applied when activating the state.\n * Param values can be provided in the `ui-sref` value after the state name, enclosed by parentheses.\n * The content inside the parentheses is an expression, evaluated to the parameter values.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * This example renders a list of links to users.\n * The state's `userId` parameter value comes from each user's `user.id` property.\n * ```html\n * <li ng-repeat=\"user in users\">\n *   <a ui-sref=\"users.detail({ userId: user.id })\">{{ user.displayName }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * Note:\n * The parameter values expression is `$watch`ed for updates.\n *\n * ### Transition Options\n * You can specify [[TransitionOptions]] to pass to [[StateService.go]] by using the `ui-sref-opts` attribute.\n * Options are restricted to `location`, `inherit`, and `reload`.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"home\" ui-sref-opts=\"{ reload: true }\">Home</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Other DOM Events\n *\n * You can also customize which DOM events to respond to (instead of `click`) by\n * providing an `events` array in the `ui-sref-opts` attribute.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <input type=\"text\" ui-sref=\"contacts\" ui-sref-opts=\"{ events: ['change', 'blur'] }\">\n * ```\n *\n * ### Highlighting the active link\n * This directive can be used in conjunction with [[uiSrefActive]] to highlight the active link.\n *\n * ### Examples\n * If you have the following template:\n *\n * ```html\n * <a ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a>\n * <a ui-sref=\"about\">About</a>\n * <a ui-sref=\"{page: 2}\">Next page</a>\n *\n * <ul>\n *     <li ng-repeat=\"contact in contacts\">\n *         <a ui-sref=\"contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })\">{{ contact.name }}</a>\n *     </li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Then (assuming the current state is `contacts`) the rendered html including hrefs would be:\n *\n * ```html\n * <a href=\"#/home\" ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a>\n * <a href=\"#/about\"

state\n *\n * A directive which links to a state (and optionally, parameters).\n * When clicked, this directive activates the linked state with the supplied parameter values.\n *\n * **This directive is very similar to [[uiSref]], but it `$observe`s and `$watch`es/evaluates all its inputs.**\n *\n * A directive which links to a state (and optionally, parameters).\n * When clicked, this directive activates the linked state with the supplied parameter values.\n *\n * ### Linked State\n * The attribute value of `ui-state` is an expression which is `$watch`ed and evaluated as the state to link to.\n * **This is in contrast with `ui-sref`, which takes a state name as a string literal.**\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Create a list of links.\n * ```html\n * <li ng-repeat=\"link in navlinks\">\n *   <a ui-state=\"link.state\">{{ link.displayName }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Relative Links\n * If the expression evaluates to a relative path, it is processed like [[uiSref]].\n * You just need to be aware that the path is relative to the state that *created* the link.\n * This allows a state to create relative `ui-state` which always targets the same destination.\n *\n * ### hrefs\n * If the linked state has a URL, the directive will automatically generate and\n * update the `href` attribute (using the [[StateService.href]]  method).\n *\n * ### Parameter Values\n * In addition to the state name expression, a `ui-state` can include parameter values which are applied when activating the state.\n * Param values should be provided using the `ui-state-params` attribute.\n * The `ui-state-params` attribute value is `$watch`ed and evaluated as an expression.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * This example renders a list of links with param values.\n * The state's `userId` parameter value comes from each user's `user.id` property.\n * ```html\n * <li ng-repeat=\"link in navlinks\">\n *   <a ui-state=\"link.state\" ui-state-params=\"link.params\">{{ link.displayName }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Options\n * You can specify [[TransitionOptions]] to pass to [[StateService.go]] by using the `ui-state-opts` attribute.\n * Options are restricted to `location`, `inherit`, and `reload`.\n * The value of the `ui-state-opts` is `$watch`ed and evaluated as an expression.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <a ui-state=\"returnto.state\" ui-state-opts=\"{ reload: true }\">Home</a>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Other DOM Events\n *\n * You can also customize which DOM events to respond to (instead of `click`) by\n * providing an `events` array in the `ui-state-opts` attribute.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <input type=\"text\" ui-state=\"contacts\" ui-state-opts=\"{ events: ['change', 'blur'] }\">\n * ```\n *\n * ### Highlighting the active link\n * This directive can be used in conjunction with [[uiSrefActive]] to highlight the active link.\n *\n * ### Notes\n *\n * - You can use `ui-params` to change **only the parameter values** by omitting the state name and supplying only `ui-state-params`.\n *   However, it might be simpler to use [[uiSref]] parameter-only links.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Sets the `lang` parameter to `en` and remains on the same state.\n *\n * ```html\n * <a ui-state=\"\" ui-state-params=\"{ lang: 'en' }\">English</a>\n * ```\n *\n * - A middle-click, right-click, or ctrl-click is handled (natively) by the browser to open the href in a new window, for example.\n * ```\n */\nvar uiState;\nuiState = ['$uiRouter', '$timeout',\n    function $StateRefDynamicDirective($uiRouter, $timeout)

}];\n/**\n * `ui-sref-active` and `ui-sref-active-eq`: A directive that adds a CSS class when a `ui-sref` is active\n *\n * A directive working alongside [[uiSref]] and [[uiState]] to add classes to an element when the\n * related directive's state is active (and remove them when it is inactive).\n *\n * The primary use-case is to highlight the active link in navigation menus,\n * distinguishing it from the inactive menu items.\n *\n * ### Linking to a `ui-sref` or `ui-state`\n * `ui-sref-active` can live on the same element as `ui-sref`/`ui-state`, or it can be on a parent element.\n * If a `ui-sref-active` is a parent to more than one `ui-sref`/`ui-state`, it will apply the CSS class when **any of the links are active**.\n *\n * ### Matching\n *\n * The `ui-sref-active` directive applies the CSS class when the `ui-sref`/`ui-state`'s target state **or any child state is active**.\n * This is a \"fuzzy match\" which uses [[StateService.includes]].\n *\n * The `ui-sref-active-eq` directive applies the CSS class when the `ui-sref`/`ui-state`'s target state is directly active (not when child states are active).\n * This is an \"exact match\" which uses [[StateService.is]].\n *\n * ### Parameter values\n * If the `ui-sref`/`ui-state` includes parameter values, the current parameter values must match the link's values for the link to be highlighted.\n * This allows a list of links to the same state with different parameters to be rendered, and the correct one highlighted.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <li ng-repeat=\"user in users\" ui-sref-active=\"active\">\n *   <a ui-sref=\"user.details({ userId: user.id })\">{{ user.lastName }}</a>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Examples\n *\n * Given the following template:\n * #### Example:\n * ```html\n * <ul>\n *   <li ui-sref-active=\"active\" class=\"item\">\n *     <a href ui-sref=\"app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})\">@bilbobaggins</a>\n *   </li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * When the app state is `app.user` (or any child state),\n * and contains the state parameter \"user\" with value \"bilbobaggins\",\n * the resulting HTML will appear as (note the 'active' class):\n *\n * ```html\n * <ul>\n *   <li ui-sref-active=\"active\" class=\"item active\">\n *     <a ui-sref=\"app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})\" href=\"/users/bilbobaggins\">@bilbobaggins</a>\n *   </li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Glob mode\n *\n * It is possible to pass `ui-sref-active` an expression that evaluates to an object.\n * The objects keys represent active class names and values represent the respective state names/globs.\n * `ui-sref-active` will match if the current active state **includes** any of\n * the specified state names/globs, even the abstract ones.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * Given the following template, with \"admin\" being an abstract state:\n * ```html\n * <div ui-sref-active=\"{'active': 'admin.**'}\">\n *   <a ui-sref-active=\"active\" ui-sref=\"admin.roles\">Roles</a>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * When the current state is \"admin.roles\" the \"active\" class will be applied to both the <div> and <a> elements.\n * It is important to note that the state names/globs passed to `ui-sref-active` override any state provided by a linked `ui-sref`.\n *\n * ### Notes:\n *\n * - The class name is interpolated **once** during the directives link time (any further changes to the\n * interpolated value are ignored).\n *\n * - Multiple classes may be specified in a space-separated format: `ui-sref-active='class1 class2 class3'`\n */\nvar uiSrefActive;\nuiSrefActive = ['$state',

active state.\n *\n * ### Attributes\n *\n * - `name`: (Optional) A view name.\n *   The name should be unique amongst the other views in the same state.\n *   You can have views of the same name that live in different states.\n *   The ui-view can be targeted in a View using the name ([[Ng1StateDeclaration.views]]).\n *\n * - `autoscroll`: an expression. When it evaluates to true, the `ui-view` will be scrolled into view when it is activated.\n *   Uses [[$uiViewScroll]] to do the scrolling.\n *\n * - `onload`: Expression to evaluate whenever the view updates.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * A view can be unnamed or named.\n * ```html\n * <!-- Unnamed -->\n * <div ui-view></div>\n *\n * <!-- Named -->\n * <div ui-view=\"viewName\"></div>\n *\n * <!-- Named (different style) -->\n * <ui-view name=\"viewName\"></ui-view>\n * ```\n *\n * You can only have one unnamed view within any template (or root html). If you are only using a\n * single view and it is unnamed then you can populate it like so:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ui-view></div>\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * The above is a convenient shortcut equivalent to specifying your view explicitly with the\n * [[Ng1StateDeclaration.views]] config property, by name, in this case an empty name:\n *\n * ```js\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * But typically you'll only use the views property if you name your view or have more than one view\n * in the same template. There's not really a compelling reason to name a view if its the only one,\n * but you could if you wanted, like so:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ui-view=\"main\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"main\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * Really though, you'll use views to set up multiple views:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ui-view></div>\n * <div ui-view=\"chart\"></div>\n * <div ui-view=\"data\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     },\n *     \"chart\": {\n *       template: \"<chart_thing/>\"\n *     },\n *     \"data\": {\n *       template: \"<data_thing/>\"\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * #### Examples for `autoscroll`:\n * ```html\n * <!-- If autoscroll present with no expression,\n *      then scroll ui-view into view -->\n * <ui-view autoscroll/>\n *\n * <!-- If autoscroll present with valid expression,\n *      then scroll ui-view into view if expression evaluates to true -->\n * <ui-view autoscroll='true'/>\n * <ui-view autoscroll='false'/>\n * <ui-view autoscroll='scopeVariable'/>\n * ```\n *\n * Resolve data:\n *\n * The resolved data from the state's `resolve` block is placed on the scope as `$resolve` (this\n * can be customized using [[Ng1ViewDeclaration.resolveAs]]).  This can be then accessed from the template.\n *\n * Note that when `controllerAs` is being used, `$resolve` is set on the controller instance *after* the\n * controller is instantiated.  The `$onInit()` hook can be used to perform initialization code which\n * depends on `$resolve` data.\n *\n * #### Example:\n * ```js\n * $stateProvider.state('home', {\n *   template: '<my-component user=\"$resolve.user\"></my-component>',\n *   resolve: {\n *     user: function(UserService) { return UserService.fetchUser(); }\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n */\nvar uiView;\nuiView = ['$view',

Multiple search parameter names are separated by '&'. Search parameters\n * do not influence whether or not a URL is matched, but their values are passed through into\n * the matched parameters returned by [[UrlMatcher.exec]].\n *\n * - *Path parameters* are defined using curly brace placeholders (`/somepath/{param}`)\n * or colon placeholders (`/somePath/:param`).\n *\n * - *A parameter RegExp* may be defined for a param after a colon\n * (`/somePath/{param:[a-zA-Z0-9]+}`) in a curly brace placeholder.\n * The regexp must match for the url to be matched.\n * Should the regexp itself contain curly braces, they must be in matched pairs or escaped with a backslash.\n *\n * Note: a RegExp parameter will encode its value using either [[ParamTypes.path]] or [[ParamTypes.query]].\n *\n * - *Custom parameter types* may also be specified after a colon (`/somePath/{param:int}`) in curly brace parameters.\n *   See [[UrlMatcherFactory.type]] for more information.\n *\n * - *Catch-all parameters* are defined using an asterisk placeholder (`/somepath/*catchallparam`).\n *   A catch-all * parameter value will contain the remainder of the URL.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * Parameter names may contain only word characters (latin letters, digits, and underscore) and\n * must be unique within the pattern (across both path and search parameters).\n * A path parameter matches any number of characters other than '/'. For catch-all\n * placeholders the path parameter matches any number of characters.\n *\n * Examples:\n *\n * * `'/hello/'` - Matches only if the path is exactly '/hello/'. There is no special treatment for\n *   trailing slashes, and patterns have to match the entire path, not just a prefix.\n * * `'/user/:id'` - Matches '/user/bob' or '/user/1234!!!' or even '/user/' but not '/user' or\n *   '/user/bob/details'. The second path segment will be captured as the parameter 'id'.\n * * `'/user/{id}'` - Same as the previous example, but using curly brace syntax.\n * * `'/user/{id:[^/]*}'` - Same as the previous example.\n * * `'/user/{id:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,8}}'` - Similar to the previous example, but only matches if the id\n *   parameter consists of 1 to 8 hex digits.\n * * `'/files/{path:.*}'` - Matches any URL starting with '/files/' and captures the rest of the\n *   path into the parameter 'path'.\n * * `'/files/*path'` - ditto.\n * * `'/calendar/{start:date}'` - Matches \"/calendar/2014-11-12\" (because the pattern defined\n *   in the built-in  `date` ParamType matches `2014-11-12`) and provides a Date object in $stateParams.start\n *\n */\nvar UrlMatcher = /** @class */ (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param pattern The pattern to compile into a matcher.\n     * @param paramTypes The [[ParamTypes]] registry\n     * @param config  A configuration object\n     * - `caseInsensitive` - `true` if URL matching should be case insensitive, otherwise `false`, the default value (for backward compatibility) is `false`.\n     * - `strict` - `false` if matching against a URL with a trailing slash should be treated as equivalent to a URL without a trailing slash, the default value is `true`.\n     */\n    function UrlMatcher(pattern, paramTypes, paramFactory, config) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.config = config;\n        /** @hidden */\n        this._cache = { path: [this] };\n        /** @hidden */\n        this._children = [];\n        /** @hidden */\n        this._params = [];\n        /** @hidden */\n        this._segments = [];\n        /** @hidden */\n        this._compiled = [];\n        this.pattern = pattern;\n        this.config = common_1.defaults(this.config, {\n            params: {},\n            strict: true,\n            caseInsensitive: false,\n            paramMap: common_1.identity\n        });\n        // Find all placeholders and create a compiled pattern, using either classic or curly syntax:\n        //   '*' name\n        //   ':' name\n        //   '{' name '}'\n        //   '{' name ':' regexp '}'\n        // The regular expression is somewhat complicated due to the need to allow curly braces\n        // inside the regular expression.

The `ngApp` directive\n * designates the **root element** of the application and is typically placed near the root element\n * of the page - e.g. on the `<body>` or `<html>` tags.\n *\n * There are a few things to keep in mind when using `ngApp`:\n * - only one AngularJS application can be auto-bootstrapped per HTML document. The first `ngApp`\n *   found in the document will be used to define the root element to auto-bootstrap as an\n *   application. To run multiple applications in an HTML document you must manually bootstrap them using\n *   {@link angular.bootstrap} instead.\n * - AngularJS applications cannot be nested within each other.\n * - Do not use a directive that uses {@link ng.$compile#transclusion transclusion} on the same element as `ngApp`.\n *   This includes directives such as {@link ng.ngIf `ngIf`}, {@link ng.ngInclude `ngInclude`} and\n *   {@link ngRoute.ngView `ngView`}.\n *   Doing this misplaces the app {@link ng.$rootElement `$rootElement`} and the app's {@link auto.$injector injector},\n *   causing animations to stop working and making the injector inaccessible from outside the app.\n *\n * You can specify an **AngularJS module** to be used as the root module for the application.  This\n * module will be loaded into the {@link auto.$injector} when the application is bootstrapped. It\n * should contain the application code needed or have dependencies on other modules that will\n * contain the code. See {@link angular.module} for more information.\n *\n * In the example below if the `ngApp` directive were not placed on the `html` element then the\n * document would not be compiled, the `AppController` would not be instantiated and the `{{ a+b }}`\n * would not be resolved to `3`.\n *\n * @example\n *\n * ### Simple Usage\n *\n * `ngApp` is the easiest, and most common way to bootstrap an application.\n *\n <example module=\"ngAppDemo\" name=\"ng-app\">\n   <file name=\"index.html\">\n   <div ng-controller=\"ngAppDemoController\">\n     I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}\n   </div>\n   </file>\n   <file name=\"script.js\">\n   angular.module('ngAppDemo', []).controller('ngAppDemoController', function($scope) {\n     $scope.a = 1;\n     $scope.b = 2;\n   });\n   </file>\n </example>\n *\n * @example\n *\n * ### With `ngStrictDi`\n *\n * Using `ngStrictDi`, you would see something like this:\n *\n <example ng-app-included=\"true\" name=\"strict-di\">\n   <file name=\"index.html\">\n   <div ng-app=\"ngAppStrictDemo\" ng-strict-di>\n       <div ng-controller=\"GoodController1\">\n           I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}\n\n           <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to\n              instantiate, by using explicit annotation style (see\n              script.js for details)\n           </p>\n       </div>\n\n       <div ng-controller=\"GoodController2\">\n           Name: <input ng-model=\"name\"><br />\n           Hello, {{name}}!\n\n           <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to\n              instantiate, by using explicit annotation style\n              (see script.js for details)\n           </p>\n       </div>\n\n       <div ng-controller=\"BadController\">\n           I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}\n\n           <p>The controller could not be instantiated, due to relying\n              on automatic function annotations (which are disabled in\n              strict mode).

@description\n * Wraps a raw DOM element or HTML string as a [jQuery](http://jquery.com) element.\n *\n * If jQuery is available, `angular.element` is an alias for the\n * [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/) function. If jQuery is not available, `angular.element`\n * delegates to Angular's built-in subset of jQuery, called \"jQuery lite\" or **jqLite**.\n *\n * jqLite is a tiny, API-compatible subset of jQuery that allows\n * Angular to manipulate the DOM in a cross-browser compatible way. jqLite implements only the most\n * commonly needed functionality with the goal of having a very small footprint.\n *\n * To use `jQuery`, simply ensure it is loaded before the `angular.js` file. You can also use the\n * {@link ngJq `ngJq`} directive to specify that jqlite should be used over jQuery, or to use a\n * specific version of jQuery if multiple versions exist on the page.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-info\">**Note:** All element references in Angular are always wrapped with jQuery or\n * jqLite (such as the element argument in a directive's compile / link function). They are never raw DOM references.</div>\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">**Note:** Keep in mind that this function will not find elements\n * by tag name / CSS selector. For lookups by tag name, try instead `angular.element(document).find(...)`\n * or `$document.find()`, or use the standard DOM APIs, e.g. `document.querySelectorAll()`.</div>\n *\n * ## Angular's jqLite\n * jqLite provides only the following jQuery methods:\n *\n * - [`addClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/addClass/) - Does not support a function as first argument\n * - [`after()`](http://api.jquery.com/after/)\n * - [`append()`](http://api.jquery.com/append/)\n * - [`attr()`](http://api.jquery.com/attr/) - Does not support functions as parameters\n * - [`bind()`](http://api.jquery.com/bind/) (_deprecated_, use [`on()`](http://api.jquery.com/on/)) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData\n * - [`children()`](http://api.jquery.com/children/) - Does not support selectors\n * - [`clone()`](http://api.jquery.com/clone/)\n * - [`contents()`](http://api.jquery.com/contents/)\n * - [`css()`](http://api.jquery.com/css/) - Only retrieves inline-styles, does not call `getComputedStyle()`.\n *   As a setter, does not convert numbers to strings or append 'px', and also does not have automatic property prefixing.\n * - [`data()`](http://api.jquery.com/data/)\n * - [`detach()`](http://api.jquery.com/detach/)\n * - [`empty()`](http://api.jquery.com/empty/)\n * - [`eq()`](http://api.jquery.com/eq/)\n * - [`find()`](http://api.jquery.com/find/) - Limited to lookups by tag name\n * - [`hasClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/)\n * - [`html()`](http://api.jquery.com/html/)\n * - [`next()`](http://api.jquery.com/next/) - Does not support selectors\n * - [`on()`](http://api.jquery.com/on/) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData\n * - [`off()`](http://api.jquery.com/off/) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or event object as parameter\n * - [`one()`](http://api.jquery.com/one/) - Does not support namespaces or selectors\n * - [`parent()`](http://api.jquery.com/parent/) - Does not support selectors\n * - [`prepend()`](http://api.jquery.com/prepend/)\n * - [`prop()`](http://api.jquery.com/prop/)\n * - [`ready()`](http://api.jquery.com/ready/) (_deprecated_, use `angular.element(callback)` instead of `angular.element(document).ready(callback)`)\n * - [`remove()`](http://api.jquery.com/remove/)\n * - [`removeAttr()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/) - Does not support multiple attributes\n * - [`removeClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/) - Does not support a function as first argument\n * - [`removeData()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeData/)\n * - [`replaceWith()`](http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/)\n * - [`text()`](http://api.jquery.com/text/)\n * - [`toggleClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/) - Does not support a function as first argument\n * - [`triggerHandler()`](http://api.jquery.com/triggerHandler/) - Passes a dummy event object to handlers\n * - [`unbind()`](http://api.jquery.com/unbind/) (_deprecated_, use [`off()`](http://api.jquery.com/off/)) - Does not support namespaces or event object as parameter\n * - [`val()`](http://api.jquery.com/val/)\n * - [`wrap()`](http://api.jquery.com/wrap/)\n *\n * ## jQuery/jqLite Extras\n * Angular also provides the following additional methods and events to both jQuery and jqLite:\n *\n * ### Events\n * - `$destroy` - AngularJS intercepts all jqLite/jQuery's DOM destruction apis and fires this event\n *    on all DOM nodes being removed.  This can be used to clean up any 3rd party bindings to the DOM\n *    element before it is removed.\n *\n * ### Methods\n * - `controller(name)` - retrieves the controller of the current element or its parent. By default\n *   retrieves controller associated with the `ngController` directive. If `name` is provided as\n *   camelCase directive name, then the controller for this directive will be retrieved (e.g.\n *   `'ngModel'`).\n * - `injector()` - retrieves the injector of the current element or its parent.\n * - `scope()` - retrieves the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} of the current\n *   element or its parent. Requires {@link guide/production#disabling-debug-data Debug Data} to\n *   be enabled.\n * - `isolateScope()` - retrieves an isolate {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} if one is attached directly to the\n *   current element. This getter should be used only on elements that contain a directive which starts a new isolate\n *   scope.

This API is\n * used by the injector to determine which services need to be injected into the function when the\n * function is invoked. There are three ways in which the function can be annotated with the needed\n * dependencies.\n *\n * #### Argument names\n *\n * The simplest form is to extract the dependencies from the arguments of the function. This is done\n * by converting the function into a string using `toString()` method and extracting the argument\n * names.\n * ```js\n *   // Given\n *   function MyController($scope, $route) {\n *     // ...\n *   }\n *\n *   // Then\n *   expect(injector.annotate(MyController)).toEqual(['$scope', '$route']);\n * ```\n *\n * You can disallow this method by using strict injection mode.\n *\n * This method does not work with code minification / obfuscation. For this reason the following\n * annotation strategies are supported.\n *\n * #### The `$inject` property\n *\n * If a function has an `$inject` property and its value is an array of strings, then the strings\n * represent names of services to be injected into the function.\n * ```js\n *   // Given\n *   var MyController = function(obfuscatedScope, obfuscatedRoute) {\n *     // ...\n *   }\n *   // Define function dependencies\n *   MyController['$inject'] = ['$scope', '$route'];\n *\n *   // Then\n *   expect(injector.annotate(MyController)).toEqual(['$scope', '$route']);\n * ```\n *\n * #### The array notation\n *\n * It is often desirable to inline Injected functions and that's when setting the `$inject` property\n * is very inconvenient. In these situations using the array notation to specify the dependencies in\n * a way that survives minification is a better choice:\n *\n * ```js\n *   // We wish to write this (not minification / obfuscation safe)\n *   injector.invoke(function($compile, $rootScope) {\n *     // ...\n *   });\n *\n *   // We are forced to write break inlining\n *   var tmpFn = function(obfuscatedCompile, obfuscatedRootScope) {\n *     // ...\n *   };\n *   tmpFn.$inject = ['$compile', '$rootScope'];\n *   injector.invoke(tmpFn);\n *\n *   // To better support inline function the inline annotation is supported\n *   injector.invoke(['$compile', '$rootScope', function(obfCompile, obfRootScope) {\n *     // ...\n *   }]);\n *\n *   // Therefore\n *   expect(injector.annotate(\n *      ['$compile', '$rootScope', function(obfus_$compile, obfus_$rootScope) {}])\n *    ).toEqual(['$compile', '$rootScope']);\n * ```\n *\n * @param {Function|Array.<string|Function>} fn Function for which dependent service names need to\n * be retrieved as described above.\n *\n * @param {boolean=} [strictDi=false] Disallow argument name annotation inference.\n *\n * @returns {Array.<string>} The names of the services which the function requires.\n */\n/**\n * @ngdoc method\n * @name $injector#loadNewModules\n *\n * @description\n *\n * **This is a dangerous API, which you use at your own risk!**\n *\n * Add the specified modules to the current injector.\n *\n * This method will add each of the injectables to the injector and execute all of the config and run\n * blocks for each module passed to the method.\n *\n * If a module has already been loaded into the injector then it will not be loaded again.\n *\n * * The application developer is responsible for loading the code containing the modules; and for\n * ensuring that lazy scripts are not downloaded and executed more often that desired.\n * * Previously compiled HTML will not be affected by newly loaded directives, filters and components.\n * * Modules cannot be unloaded.\n *\n * You can use {@link $injector#modules `$injector.modules`} to check whether a module has been loaded\n * into the injector, which may indicate whether the script has been executed already.\n *\n * @example\n * Here is an example of loading a bundle of modules, with a utility method called `getScript`:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * app.factory('loadModule', function($injector) {\n *   return function loadModule(moduleName, bundleUrl) {\n *     return getScript(bundleUrl).then(function() { $injector.loadNewModules([moduleName]); });\n *   };\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * @param {Array<String|Function|Array>=} mods an array of modules to load into the application.\n *     Each item in the array should be the name of a predefined module or a (DI annotated)\n *     function that will be invoked by the injector as a `config` block.\n *     See: {@link angular.module modules}\n */\n\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc service\n * @name $provide\n *\n * @description\n *\n * The {@link auto.$provide $provide} service has a number of methods for registering components\n * with the {@link auto.$injector $injector}.

You can see the default values below.\n * </div>\n *\n * Therefore the above can be simplified as:\n *\n * ```js\n *   var myModule = angular.module(...);\n *\n *   myModule.directive('directiveName', function factory(injectables) {\n *     var directiveDefinitionObject = {\n *       link: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }\n *     };\n *     return directiveDefinitionObject;\n *     // or\n *     // return function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }\n *   });\n * ```\n *\n * ### Life-cycle hooks\n * Directive controllers can provide the following methods that are called by Angular at points in the life-cycle of the\n * directive:\n * * `$onInit()` - Called on each controller after all the controllers on an element have been constructed and\n *   had their bindings initialized (and before the pre &amp; post linking functions for the directives on\n *   this element). This is a good place to put initialization code for your controller.\n * * `$onChanges(changesObj)` - Called whenever one-way (`<`) or interpolation (`@`) bindings are updated. The\n *   `changesObj` is a hash whose keys are the names of the bound properties that have changed, and the values are an\n *   object of the form `{ currentValue, previousValue, isFirstChange() }`. Use this hook to trigger updates within a\n *   component such as cloning the bound value to prevent accidental mutation of the outer value. Note that this will\n *   also be called when your bindings are initialized.\n * * `$doCheck()` - Called on each turn of the digest cycle. Provides an opportunity to detect and act on\n *   changes. Any actions that you wish to take in response to the changes that you detect must be\n *   invoked from this hook; implementing this has no effect on when `$onChanges` is called. For example, this hook\n *   could be useful if you wish to perform a deep equality check, or to check a Date object, changes to which would not\n *   be detected by Angular's change detector and thus not trigger `$onChanges`. This hook is invoked with no arguments;\n *   if detecting changes, you must store the previous value(s) for comparison to the current values.\n * * `$onDestroy()` - Called on a controller when its containing scope is destroyed. Use this hook for releasing\n *   external resources, watches and event handlers. Note that components have their `$onDestroy()` hooks called in\n *   the same order as the `$scope.$broadcast` events are triggered, which is top down. This means that parent\n *   components will have their `$onDestroy()` hook called before child components.\n * * `$postLink()` - Called after this controller's element and its children have been linked. Similar to the post-link\n *   function this hook can be used to set up DOM event handlers and do direct DOM manipulation.\n *   Note that child elements that contain `templateUrl` directives will not have been compiled and linked since\n *   they are waiting for their template to load asynchronously and their own compilation and linking has been\n *   suspended until that occurs.\n *\n * #### Comparison with Angular 2 life-cycle hooks\n * Angular 2 also uses life-cycle hooks for its components. While the Angular 1 life-cycle hooks are similar there are\n * some differences that you should be aware of, especially when it comes to moving your code from Angular 1 to Angular 2:\n *\n * * Angular 1 hooks are prefixed with `$`, such as `$onInit`. Angular 2 hooks are prefixed with `ng`, such as `ngOnInit`.\n * * Angular 1 hooks can be defined on the controller prototype or added to the controller inside its constructor.\n *   In Angular 2 you can only define hooks on the prototype of the Component class.\n * * Due to the differences in change-detection, you may get many more calls to `$doCheck` in Angular 1 than you would to\n *   `ngDoCheck` in Angular 2\n * * Changes to the model inside `$doCheck` will trigger new turns of the digest loop, which will cause the changes to be\n *   propagated throughout the application.\n *   Angular 2 does not allow the `ngDoCheck` hook to trigger a change outside of the component. It will either throw an\n *   error or do nothing depending upon the state of `enableProdMode()`.\n *\n * #### Life-cycle hook examples\n *\n * This example shows how you can check for mutations to a Date object even though the identity of the object\n * has not changed.\n *\n * <example name=\"doCheckDateExample\" module=\"do-check-module\">\n *   <file name=\"app.js\">\n *     angular.module('do-check-module', [])\n *       .component('app', {\n *         template:\n *           'Month: <input ng-model=\"$ctrl.month\" ng-change=\"$ctrl.updateDate()\">' +\n *           'Date: {{ $ctrl.date }}' +\n *           '<test date=\"$ctrl.date\"></test>',\n *         controller: function() {\n *           this.date = new Date();\n *           this.month = this.date.getMonth();\n *           this.updateDate = function() {\n *             this.date.setMonth(this.month);\n *           };\n *         }\n *       })\n *       .component('test', {\n *         bindings: { date: '<' },\n *         template:\n *           '<pre>{{ $ctrl.log | json }}</pre>',\n *         controller: function() {\n *           var previousValue;\n *           this.log = [];\n *           this.$doCheck = function() {\n *             var currentValue = this.date && this.date.valueOf();\n *             if (previousValue !== currentValue) {\n *               this.log.push('doCheck: date mutated: ' + this.date);\n *               previousValue = currentValue;\n *             }\n *           };\n *         }\n *       });\n *   </file>\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *     <app></app>\n *   </file>\n * </example>\n *\n * This example show how you might use `$doCheck` to trigger changes in your component's inputs even if the\n * actual identity of the component doesn't change. (Be aware that cloning and deep equality checks on large\n * arrays or objects can have a negative impact on your application performance)\n *\n * <example name=\"doCheckArrayExample\" module=\"do-check-module\">\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *     <div ng-init=\"items = []\">\n *       <button ng-click=\"items.push(items.length)\">Add Item</button>\n *       <button ng-click=\"items = []\">Reset Items</button>\n *       <pre>{{ items }}</pre>\n *       <test items=\"items\"></test>\n *     </div>\n *   </file>\n *   <file name=\"app.js\">\n *      angular.module('do-check-module', [])\n *        .component('test', {\n *          bindings: { items: '<' },\n *          template:\n *            '<pre>{{ $ctrl.log | json }}</pre>',\n *          controller: function() {\n *            this.log = [];\n *\n *            this.$doCheck = function() {\n *              if (this.items_ref !== this.items) {\n *                this.log.push('doCheck: items changed');\n *                this.items_ref = this.items;\n *              }\n *              if (!angular.equals(this.items_clone, this.items)) {\n *                this.log.push('doCheck: items mutated');\n *                this.items_clone = angular.copy(this.items);\n *              }\n *            };\n *          }\n *        });\n *   </file>\n * </example>\n *\n *\n * ### Directive Definition Object\n *\n * The directive definition object provides instructions to the {@link ng.$compile\n * compiler}. The attributes are:\n *\n * #### `multiElement`\n * When this property is set to true (default is `false`), the HTML compiler will collect DOM nodes between\n * nodes with the attributes `directive-name-start` and `directive-name-end`, and group them\n * together as the directive elements. It is recommended that this feature be used on directives\n * which are not strictly behavioral (such as {@link ngClick}), and which\n * do not manipulate or replace child nodes (such as {@link ngInclude}).\n *\n * #### `priority`\n * When there are multiple directives defined on a single DOM element, sometimes it\n * is necessary to specify the order in which the directives are applied. The `priority` is used\n * to sort the directives before their `compile` functions get called. Priority is defined as a\n * number. Directives with greater numerical `priority` are compiled first. Pre-link functions\n * are also run in priority order, but post-link functions are run in reverse order. The order\n * of directives with the same priority is undefined. The default priority is `0`.\n *\n * #### `terminal`\n * If set to true then the current `priority` will be the last set of directives\n * which will execute (any directives at the current priority will still execute\n * as the order of execution on same `priority` is undefined). Note that expressions\n * and other directives used in the directive's template will also be excluded from execution.\n *\n * #### `scope`\n * The scope property can be `false`, `true`, or an object:\n *\n * * **`false` (default):** No scope will be created for the directive. The directive will use its\n * parent's scope.\n *\n * * **`true`:** A new child scope that prototypically inherits from its parent will be created for\n * the directive's element. If multiple directives on the same element request a new scope,\n * only one new scope is created.\n *\n * * **`{...}` (an object hash):** A new \"isolate\" scope is created for the directive's template.\n * The 'isolate' scope differs from normal scope in that it does not prototypically\n * inherit from its parent scope. This is useful when creating reusable components, which should not\n * accidentally read or modify data in the parent scope. Note that an isolate scope\n * directive without a `template` or `templateUrl` will not apply the isolate scope\n * to its children elements.\n *\n * The 'isolate' scope object hash defines a set of local scope properties derived from attributes on the\n * directive's element. These local properties are useful for aliasing values for templates. The keys in\n * the object hash map to the name of the property on the isolate scope; the values define how the property\n * is bound to the parent scope, via matching attributes on the directive's element:\n *\n * * `@` or `@attr` - bind a local scope property to the value of DOM attribute. The result is\n *   always a string since DOM attributes are strings. If no `attr` name is specified then the\n *   attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name. Given `<my-component\n *   my-attr=\"hello {{name}}\">` and the isolate scope definition `scope: { localName:'@myAttr' }`,\n *   the directive's scope property `localName` will reflect the interpolated value of `hello\n *   {{name}}`. As the `name` attribute changes so will the `localName` property on the directive's\n *   scope. The `name` is read from the parent scope (not the directive's scope).\n *\n * * `=` or `=attr` - set up a bidirectional binding between a local scope property and an expression\n *   passed via the attribute `attr`. The expression is evaluated in the context of the parent scope.\n *   If no `attr` name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local\n *   name. Given `<my-component my-attr=\"parentModel\">` and the isolate scope definition `scope: {\n *   localModel: '=myAttr' }`, the property `localModel` on the directive's scope will reflect the\n *   value of `parentModel` on the parent scope. Changes to `parentModel` will be reflected in\n *   `localModel` and vice versa. Optional attributes should be marked as such with a question mark:\n *   `=?` or `=?attr`. If the binding expression is non-assignable, or if the attribute isn't\n *   optional and doesn't exist, an exception ({@link error/$compile/nonassign `$compile:nonassign`})\n *   will be thrown upon discovering changes to the local value, since it will be impossible to sync\n *   them back to the parent scope. By default, the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch `$watch`}\n *   method is used for tracking changes, and the equality check is based on object identity.\n *   However, if an object literal or an array literal is passed as the binding expression, the\n *   equality check is done by value (using the {@link angular.equals} function). It's also possible\n *   to watch the evaluated value shallowly with {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watchCollection\n *   `$watchCollection`}: use `=*` or `=*attr` (`=*?` or `=*?attr` if the attribute is optional).\n *\n  * * `<` or `<attr` - set up a one-way (one-directional) binding between a local scope property and an\n *   expression passed via the attribute `attr`. The expression is evaluated in the context of the\n *   parent scope. If no `attr` name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the\n *   local name. You can also make the binding optional by adding `?`: `<?` or `<?attr`.\n *\n *   For example, given `<my-component my-attr=\"parentModel\">` and directive definition of\n *   `scope: { localModel:'<myAttr' }`, then the isolated scope property `localModel` will reflect the\n *   value of `parentModel` on the parent scope. Any changes to `parentModel` will be reflected\n *   in `localModel`, but changes in `localModel` will not reflect in `parentModel`. There are however\n *   two caveats:\n *     1. one-way binding does not copy the value from the parent to the isolate scope, it simply\n *     sets the same value. That means if your bound value is an object, changes to its properties\n *     in the isolated scope will be reflected in the parent scope (because both reference the same object).\n *     2. one-way binding watches changes to the **identity** of the parent value. That means the\n *     {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch `$watch`} on the parent value only fires if the reference\n *     to the value has changed. In most cases, this should not be of concern, but can be important\n *     to know if you one-way bind to an object, and then replace that object in the isolated scope.\n *     If you now change a property of the object in your parent scope, the change will not be\n *     propagated to the isolated scope, because the identity of the object on the parent scope\n *     has not changed. Instead you must assign a new object.\n *\n *   One-way binding is useful if you do not plan to propagate changes to your isolated scope bindings\n *   back to the parent. However, it does not make this completely impossible.\n *\n * * `&` or `&attr` - provides a way to execute an expression in the context of the parent scope. If\n *   no `attr` name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name.\n *   Given `<my-component my-attr=\"count = count + value\">` and the isolate scope definition `scope: {\n *   localFn:'&myAttr' }`, the isolate scope property `localFn` will point to a function wrapper for\n *   the `count = count + value` expression. Often it's desirable to pass data from the isolated scope\n *   via an expression to the parent scope. This can be done by passing a map of local variable names\n *   and values into the expression wrapper fn. For example, if the expression is `increment(amount)`\n *   then we can specify the amount value by calling the `localFn` as `localFn({amount: 22})`.\n *\n * In general it's possible to apply more than one directive to one element, but there might be limitations\n * depending on the type of scope required by the directives. The following points will help explain these limitations.\n * For simplicity only two directives are taken into account, but it is also applicable for several directives:\n *\n * * **no scope** + **no scope** => Two directives which don't require their own scope will use their parent's scope\n * * **child scope** + **no scope** =>  Both directives will share one single child scope\n * * **child scope** + **child scope** =>  Both directives will share one single child scope\n * * **isolated scope** + **no scope** =>  The isolated directive will use it's own created isolated scope. The other directive will use\n * its parent's scope\n * * **isolated scope** + **child scope** =>  **Won't work!** Only one scope can be related to one element. Therefore these directives cannot\n * be applied to the same element.\n * * **isolated scope** + **isolated scope**  =>  **Won't work!** Only one scope can be related to one element. Therefore these directives\n * cannot be applied to the same element.\n *\n *\n * #### `bindToController`\n * This property is used to bind scope properties directly to the controller. It can be either\n * `true` or an object hash with the same format as the `scope` property.\n *\n * When an isolate scope is used for a directive (see above), `bindToController: true` will\n * allow a component to have its properties bound to the controller, rather than to scope.\n *\n * After the controller is instantiated, the initial values of the isolate scope bindings will be bound to the controller\n * properties. You can access these bindings once they have been initialized by providing a controller method called\n * `$onInit`, which is called after all the controllers on an element have been constructed and had their bindings\n * initialized.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Deprecation warning:** if `$compileProcvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled(true)` was called, bindings for non-ES6 class\n * controllers are bound to `this` before the controller constructor is called but this use is now deprecated. Please\n * place initialization code that relies upon bindings inside a `$onInit` method on the controller, instead.\n * </div>\n *\n * It is also possible to set `bindToController` to an object hash with the same format as the `scope` property.\n * This will set up the scope bindings to the controller directly. Note that `scope` can still be used\n * to define which kind of scope is created. By default, no scope is created. Use `scope: {}` to create an isolate\n * scope (useful for component directives).\n *\n * If both `bindToController` and `scope` are defined and have object hashes, `bindToController` overrides `scope`.\n *\n *\n * #### `controller`\n * Controller constructor function. The controller is instantiated before the\n * pre-linking phase and can be accessed by other directives (see\n * `require` attribute). This allows the directives to communicate with each other and augment\n * each other's behavior. The controller is injectable (and supports bracket notation) with the following locals:\n *\n * * `$scope` - Current scope associated with the element\n * * `$element` - Current element\n * * `$attrs` - Current attributes object for the element\n * * `$transclude` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope:\n *   `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn, futureParentElement, slotName)`:\n *    * `scope`: (optional) override the scope.\n *    * `cloneLinkingFn`: (optional) argument to create clones of the original transcluded content.\n *    * `futureParentElement` (optional):\n *        * defines the parent to which the `cloneLinkingFn` will add the cloned elements.\n *        * default: `$element.parent()` resp. `$element` for `transclude:'element'` resp. `transclude:true`.\n *        * only needed for transcludes that are allowed to contain non html elements (e.g. SVG elements)\n *          and when the `cloneLinkingFn` is passed,\n *          as those elements need to created and cloned in a special way when they are defined outside their\n *          usual containers (e.g. like `<svg>`).\n *        * See also the `directive.templateNamespace` property.\n *    * `slotName`: (optional) the name of the slot to transclude. If falsy (e.g. `null`, `undefined` or `''`)\n *      then the default transclusion is provided.\n *    The `$transclude` function also has a method on it, `$transclude.isSlotFilled(slotName)`, which returns\n *    `true` if the specified slot contains content (i.e. one or more DOM nodes).\n *\n * #### `require`\n * Require another directive and inject its controller as the fourth argument to the linking function. The\n * `require` property can be a string, an array or an object:\n * * a **string** containing the name of the directive to pass to the linking function\n * * an **array** containing the names of directives to pass to the linking function. The argument passed to the\n * linking function will be an array of controllers in the same order as the names in the `require` property\n * * an **object** whose property values are the names of the directives to pass to the linking function. The argument\n * passed to the linking function will also be an object with matching keys, whose values will hold the corresponding\n * controllers.\n *\n * If the `require` property is an object and `bindToController` is truthy, then the required controllers are\n * bound to the controller using the keys of the `require` property. This binding occurs after all the controllers\n * have been constructed but before `$onInit` is called.\n * If the name of the required controller is the same as the local name (the key), the name can be\n * omitted. For example, `{parentDir: '^^'}` is equivalent to `{parentDir: '^^parentDir'}`.\n * See the {@link $compileProvider#component} helper for an example of how this can be used.\n * If no such required directive(s) can be found, or if the directive does not have a controller, then an error is\n * raised (unless no link function is specified and the required controllers are not being bound to the directive\n * controller, in which case error checking is skipped). The name can be prefixed with:\n *\n * * (no prefix) - Locate the required controller on the current element. Throw an error if not found.\n * * `?` - Attempt to locate the required controller or pass `null` to the `link` fn if not found.\n * * `^` - Locate the required controller by searching the element and its parents. Throw an error if not found.\n * * `^^` - Locate the required controller by searching the element's parents. Throw an error if not found.\n * * `?^` - Attempt to locate the required controller by searching the element and its parents or pass\n *   `null` to the `link` fn if not found.\n * * `?^^` - Attempt to locate the required controller by searching the element's parents, or pass\n *   `null` to the `link` fn if not found.\n *\n *\n * #### `controllerAs`\n * Identifier name for a reference to the controller in the directive's scope.\n * This allows the controller to be referenced from the directive template. This is especially\n * useful when a directive is used as component, i.e. with an `isolate` scope. It's also possible\n * to use it in a directive without an `isolate` / `new` scope, but you need to be aware that the\n * `controllerAs` reference might overwrite a property that already exists on the parent scope.\n *\n *\n * #### `restrict`\n * String of subset of `EACM` which restricts the directive to a specific directive\n * declaration style. If omitted, the defaults (elements and attributes) are used.\n *\n * * `E` - Element name (default): `<my-directive></my-directive>`\n * * `A` - Attribute (default): `<div my-directive=\"exp\"></div>`\n * * `C` - Class: `<div class=\"my-directive: exp;\"></div>`\n * * `M` - Comment: `<!-- directive: my-directive exp -->`\n *\n *\n * #### `templateNamespace`\n * String representing the document type used by the markup in the template.\n * AngularJS needs this information as those elements need to be created and cloned\n * in a special way when they are defined outside their usual containers like `<svg>` and `<math>`.\n *\n * * `html` - All root nodes in the template are HTML. Root nodes may also be\n *   top-level elements such as `<svg>` or `<math>`.\n * * `svg` - The root nodes in the template are SVG elements (excluding `<math>`).\n * * `math` - The root nodes in the template are MathML elements (excluding `<svg>`).\n *\n * If no `templateNamespace` is specified, then the namespace is considered to be `html`.\n *\n * #### `template`\n * HTML markup that may:\n * * Replace the contents of the directive's element (default).\n * * Replace the directive's element itself (if `replace` is true - DEPRECATED).\n * * Wrap the contents of the directive's element (if `transclude` is true).\n *\n * Value may be:\n *\n * * A string. For example `<div red-on-hover>{{delete_str}}</div>`.\n * * A function which takes two arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile`\n *   function api below) and returns a string value.\n *\n *\n * #### `templateUrl`\n * This is similar to `template` but the template is loaded from the specified URL, asynchronously.\n *\n * Because template loading is asynchronous the compiler will suspend compilation of directives on that element\n * for later when the template has been resolved.  In the meantime it will continue to compile and link\n * sibling and parent elements as though this element had not contained any directives.\n *\n * The compiler does not suspend the entire compilation to wait for templates to be loaded because this\n * would result in the whole app \"stalling\" until all templates are loaded asynchronously - even in the\n * case when only one deeply nested directive has `templateUrl`.\n *\n * Template loading is asynchronous even if the template has been preloaded into the {@link $templateCache}\n *\n * You can specify `templateUrl` as a string representing the URL or as a function which takes two\n * arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile` function api below) and returns\n * a string value representing the url.  In either case, the template URL is passed through {@link\n * $sce#getTrustedResourceUrl $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl}.\n *\n *\n * #### `replace` (*DEPRECATED*)\n *\n * `replace` will be removed in next major release - i.e. v2.0).\n *\n * Specifies what the template should replace. Defaults to `false`.\n *\n * * `true` - the template will replace the directive's element.\n * * `false` - the template will replace the contents of the directive's element.\n *\n * The replacement process migrates all of the attributes / classes from the old element to the new\n * one. See the {@link guide/directive#template-expanding-directive\n * Directives Guide} for an example.\n *\n * There are very few scenarios where element replacement is required for the application function,\n * the main one being reusable custom components that are used within SVG contexts\n * (because SVG doesn't work with custom elements in the DOM tree).\n *\n * #### `transclude`\n * Extract the contents of the element where the directive appears and make it available to the directive.\n * The contents are compiled and provided to the directive as a **transclusion function**. See the\n * {@link $compile#transclusion Transclusion} section below.\n *\n *\n * #### `compile`\n *\n * ```js\n *   function compile(tElement, tAttrs, transclude) { ... }\n * ```\n *\n * The compile function deals with transforming the template DOM. Since most directives do not do\n * template transformation, it is not used often. The compile function takes the following arguments:\n *\n *   * `tElement` - template element - The element where the directive has been declared. It is\n *     safe to do template transformation on the element and child elements only.\n *\n *   * `tAttrs` - template attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared\n *     between all directive compile functions.\n *\n *   * `transclude` -  [*DEPRECATED*!] A transclude linking function: `function(scope, cloneLinkingFn)`\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** The template instance and the link instance may be different objects if the template has\n * been cloned. For this reason it is **not** safe to do anything other than DOM transformations that\n * apply to all cloned DOM nodes within the compile function. Specifically, DOM listener registration\n * should be done in a linking function rather than in a compile function.\n * </div>\n\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** The compile function cannot handle directives that recursively use themselves in their\n * own templates or compile functions. Compiling these directives results in an infinite loop and\n * stack overflow errors.\n *\n * This can be avoided by manually using $compile in the postLink function to imperatively compile\n * a directive's template instead of relying on automatic template compilation via `template` or\n * `templateUrl` declaration or manual compilation inside the compile function.\n * </div>\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-danger\">\n * **Note:** The `transclude` function that is passed to the compile function is deprecated, as it\n *   e.g. does not know about the right outer scope. Please use the transclude function that is passed\n *   to the link function instead.\n * </div>\n\n * A compile function can have a return value which can be either a function or an object.\n *\n * * returning a (post-link) function - is equivalent to registering the linking function via the\n *   `link` property of the config object when the compile function is empty.\n *\n * * returning an object with function(s) registered via `pre` and `post` properties - allows you to\n *   control when a linking function should be called during the linking phase. See info about\n *   pre-linking and post-linking functions below.\n *\n *\n * #### `link`\n * This property is used only if the `compile` property is not defined.\n *\n * ```js\n *   function link(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller, transcludeFn) { ... }\n * ```\n *\n * The link function is responsible for registering DOM listeners as well as updating the DOM. It is\n * executed after the template has been cloned. This is where most of the directive logic will be\n * put.\n *\n *   * `scope` - {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} - The scope to be used by the\n *     directive for registering {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watches}.\n *\n *   * `iElement` - instance element - The element where the directive is to be used. It is safe to\n *     manipulate the children of the element only in `postLink` function since the children have\n *     already been linked.\n *\n *   * `iAttrs` - instance attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared\n *     between all directive linking functions.\n *\n *   * `controller` - the directive's required controller instance(s) - Instances are shared\n *     among all directives, which allows the directives to use the controllers as a communication\n *     channel. The exact value depends on the directive's `require` property:\n *       * no controller(s) required: the directive's own controller, or `undefined` if it doesn't have one\n *       * `string`: the controller instance\n *       * `array`: array of controller instances\n *\n *     If a required controller cannot be found, and it is optional, the instance is `null`,\n *     otherwise the {@link error:$compile:ctreq Missing Required Controller} error is thrown.\n *\n *     Note that you can also require the directive's own controller - it will be made available like\n *     any other controller.\n *\n *   * `transcludeFn` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope.\n *     This is the same as the `$transclude` parameter of directive controllers,\n *     see {@link ng.$compile#-controller- the controller section for details}.\n *     `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn, futureParentElement)`.\n *\n * #### Pre-linking function\n *\n * Executed before the child elements are linked. Not safe to do DOM transformation since the\n * compiler linking function will fail to locate the correct elements for linking.\n *\n * #### Post-linking function\n *\n * Executed after the child elements are linked.\n *\n * Note that child elements that contain `templateUrl` directives will not have been compiled\n * and linked since they are waiting for their template to load asynchronously and their own\n * compilation and linking has been suspended until that occurs.\n *\n * It is safe to do DOM transformation in the post-linking function on elements that are not waiting\n * for their async templates to be resolved.\n *\n *\n * ### Transclusion\n *\n * Transclusion is the process of extracting a collection of DOM elements from one part of the DOM and\n * copying them to another part of the DOM, while maintaining their connection to the original AngularJS\n * scope from where they were taken.\n *\n * Transclusion is used (often with {@link ngTransclude}) to insert the\n * original contents of a directive's element into a specified place in the template of the directive.\n * The benefit of transclusion, over simply moving the DOM elements manually, is that the transcluded\n * content has access to the properties on the scope from which it was taken, even if the directive\n * has isolated scope.\n * See the {@link guide/directive#creating-a-directive-that-wraps-other-elements Directives Guide}.\n *\n * This makes it possible for the widget to have private state for its template, while the transcluded\n * content has access to its originating scope.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** When testing an element transclude directive you must not place the directive at the root of the\n * DOM fragment that is being compiled. See {@link guide/unit-testing#testing-transclusion-directives\n * Testing Transclusion Directives}.\n * </div>\n *\n * There are three kinds of transclusion depending upon whether you want to transclude just the contents of the\n * directive's element, the entire element or multiple parts of the element contents:\n *\n * * `true` - transclude the content (i.e. the child nodes) of the directive's element.\n * * `'element'` - transclude the whole of the directive's element including any directives on this\n *   element that defined at a lower priority than this directive. When used, the `template`\n *   property is ignored.\n * * **`{...}` (an object hash):** - map elements of the content onto transclusion \"slots\" in the template.\n *\n * **Mult-slot transclusion** is declared by providing an object for the `transclude` property.\n *\n * This object is a map where the keys are the name of the slot to fill and the value is an element selector\n * used to match the HTML to the slot. The element selector should be in normalized form (e.g. `myElement`)\n * and will match the standard element variants (e.g. `my-element`, `my:element`, `data-my-element`, etc).\n *\n * For further information check out the guide on {@link guide/directive#matching-directives Matching Directives}\n *\n * If the element selector is prefixed with a `?` then that slot is optional.\n *\n * For example, the transclude object `{ slotA: '?myCustomElement' }` maps `<my-custom-element>` elements to\n * the `slotA` slot, which can be accessed via the `$transclude` function or via the {@link ngTransclude} directive.\n *\n * Slots that are not marked as optional (`?`) will trigger a compile time error if there are no matching elements\n * in the transclude content. If you wish to know if an optional slot was filled with content, then you can call\n * `$transclude.isSlotFilled(slotName)` on the transclude function passed to the directive's link function and\n * injectable into the directive's controller.\n *\n *\n * #### Transclusion Functions\n *\n * When a directive requests transclusion, the compiler extracts its contents and provides a **transclusion\n * function** to the directive's `link` function and `controller`. This transclusion function is a special\n * **linking function** that will return the compiled contents linked to a new transclusion scope.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n * If you are just using {@link ngTransclude} then you don't need to worry about this function, since\n * ngTransclude will deal with it for us.\n * </div>\n *\n * If you want to manually control the insertion and removal of the transcluded content in your directive\n * then you must use this transclude function. When you call a transclude function it returns a a jqLite/JQuery\n * object that contains the compiled DOM, which is linked to the correct transclusion scope.\n *\n * When you call a transclusion function you can pass in a **clone attach function**. This function accepts\n * two parameters, `function(clone, scope) { ... }`, where the `clone` is a fresh compiled copy of your transcluded\n * content and the `scope` is the newly created transclusion scope, which the clone will be linked to.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n * **Best Practice**: Always provide a `cloneFn` (clone attach function) when you call a transclude function\n * since you then get a fresh clone of the original DOM and also have access to the new transclusion scope.\n * </div>\n *\n * It is normal practice to attach your transcluded content (`clone`) to the DOM inside your **clone\n * attach function**:\n *\n * ```js\n * var transcludedContent, transclusionScope;\n *\n * $transclude(function(clone, scope) {\n *   element.append(clone);\n *   transcludedContent = clone;\n *   transclusionScope = scope;\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Later, if you want to remove the transcluded content from your DOM then you should also destroy the\n * associated transclusion scope:\n *\n * ```js\n * transcludedContent.remove();\n * transclusionScope.$destroy();\n * ```\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n * **Best Practice**: if you intend to add and remove transcluded content manually in your directive\n * (by calling the transclude function to get the DOM and calling `element.remove()` to remove it),\n * then you are also responsible for calling `$destroy` on the transclusion scope.\n * </div>\n *\n * The built-in DOM manipulation directives, such as {@link ngIf}, {@link ngSwitch} and {@link ngRepeat}\n * automatically destroy their transcluded clones as necessary so you do not need to worry about this if\n * you are simply using {@link ngTransclude} to inject the transclusion into your directive.\n *\n *\n * #### Transclusion Scopes\n *\n * When you call a transclude function it returns a DOM fragment that is pre-bound to a **transclusion\n * scope**. This scope is special, in that it is a child of the directive's scope (and so gets destroyed\n * when the directive's scope gets destroyed) but it inherits the properties of the scope from which it\n * was taken.\n *\n * For example consider a directive that uses transclusion and isolated scope. The DOM hierarchy might look\n * like this:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-app>\n *   <div isolate>\n *     <div transclusion>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * The `$parent` scope hierarchy will look like this:\n *\n   ```\n   - $rootScope\n     - isolate\n       - transclusion\n   ```\n *\n * but the scopes will inherit prototypically from different scopes to their `$parent`.\n *\n   ```\n   - $rootScope\n     - transclusion\n   - isolate\n   ```\n *\n *\n * ### Attributes\n *\n * The {@link ng.$compile.directive.Attributes Attributes} object - passed as a parameter in the\n * `link()` or `compile()` functions. It has a variety of uses.\n *\n * * *Accessing normalized attribute names:* Directives like 'ngBind' can be expressed in many ways:\n *   'ng:bind', `data-ng-bind`, or 'x-ng-bind'. The attributes object allows for normalized access\n *   to the attributes.\n *\n * * *Directive inter-communication:* All directives share the same instance of the attributes\n *   object which allows the directives to use the attributes object as inter directive\n *   communication.\n *\n * * *Supports interpolation:* Interpolation attributes are assigned to the attribute object\n *   allowing other directives to read the interpolated value.\n *\n * * *Observing interpolated attributes:* Use `$observe` to observe the value changes of attributes\n *   that contain interpolation (e.g. `src=\"{{bar}}\"`). Not only is this very efficient but it's also\n *   the only way to easily get the actual value because during the linking phase the interpolation\n *   hasn't been evaluated yet and so the value is at this time set to `undefined`.\n *\n * ```js\n * function linkingFn(scope, elm, attrs, ctrl) {\n *   // get the attribute value\n *   console.log(attrs.ngModel);\n *\n *   // change the attribute\n *   attrs.$set('ngModel', 'new value');\n *\n *   // observe changes to interpolated attribute\n *   attrs.$observe('ngModel', function(value) {\n *     console.log('ngModel has changed value to ' + value);\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ## Example\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note**: Typically directives are registered with `module.directive`. The example below is\n * to illustrate how `$compile` works.\n * </div>\n *\n <example module=\"compileExample\" name=\"compile\">\n   <file name=\"index.html\">\n    <script>\n      angular.module('compileExample', [], function($compileProvider) {\n        // configure new 'compile' directive by passing a directive\n        // factory function.

Where:\n *\n *  * `scope` - A {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} to bind to.\n *  * `cloneAttachFn` - If `cloneAttachFn` is provided, then the link function will clone the\n *  `template` and call the `cloneAttachFn` function allowing the caller to attach the\n *  cloned elements to the DOM document at the appropriate place. The `cloneAttachFn` is\n *  called as: <br/> `cloneAttachFn(clonedElement, scope)` where:\n *\n *      * `clonedElement` - is a clone of the original `element` passed into the compiler.\n *      * `scope` - is the current scope with which the linking function is working with.\n *\n *  * `options` - An optional object hash with linking options. If `options` is provided, then the following\n *  keys may be used to control linking behavior:\n *\n *      * `parentBoundTranscludeFn` - the transclude function made available to\n *        directives; if given, it will be passed through to the link functions of\n *        directives found in `element` during compilation.\n *      * `transcludeControllers` - an object hash with keys that map controller names\n *        to a hash with the key `instance`, which maps to the controller instance;\n *        if given, it will make the controllers available to directives on the compileNode:\n *        ```\n *        {\n *          parent: {\n *            instance: parentControllerInstance\n *          }\n *        }\n *        ```\n *      * `futureParentElement` - defines the parent to which the `cloneAttachFn` will add\n *        the cloned elements; only needed for transcludes that are allowed to contain non html\n *        elements (e.g. SVG elements). See also the directive.controller property.\n *\n * Calling the linking function returns the element of the template. It is either the original\n * element passed in, or the clone of the element if the `cloneAttachFn` is provided.\n *\n * After linking the view is not updated until after a call to $digest which typically is done by\n * Angular automatically.\n *\n * If you need access to the bound view, there are two ways to do it:\n *\n * - If you are not asking the linking function to clone the template, create the DOM element(s)\n *   before you send them to the compiler and keep this reference around.\n *   ```js\n *     var element = $compile('<p>{{total}}</p>')(scope);\n *   ```\n *\n * - if on the other hand, you need the element to be cloned, the view reference from the original\n *   example would not point to the clone, but rather to the original template that was cloned.

Any response status code outside of that range is\n     * considered an error status and will result in the error callback being called.\n     * Also, status codes less than -1 are normalized to zero. -1 usually means the request was\n     * aborted, e.g. using a `config.timeout`.\n     * Note that if the response is a redirect, XMLHttpRequest will transparently follow it, meaning\n     * that the outcome (success or error) will be determined by the final response status code.\n     *\n     *\n     * ## Shortcut methods\n     *\n     * Shortcut methods are also available. All shortcut methods require passing in the URL, and\n     * request data must be passed in for POST/PUT requests. An optional config can be passed as the\n     * last argument.\n     *\n     * ```js\n     *   $http.get('/someUrl', config).then(successCallback, errorCallback);\n     *   $http.post('/someUrl', data, config).then(successCallback, errorCallback);\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Complete list of shortcut methods:\n     *\n     * - {@link ng.$http#get $http.get}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#head $http.head}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#post $http.post}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#put $http.put}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#delete $http.delete}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#jsonp $http.jsonp}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#patch $http.patch}\n     *\n     *\n     * ## Writing Unit Tests that use $http\n     * When unit testing (using {@link ngMock ngMock}), it is necessary to call\n     * {@link ngMock.$httpBackend#flush $httpBackend.flush()} to flush each pending\n     * request using trained responses.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * $httpBackend.expectGET(...);\n     * $http.get(...);\n     * $httpBackend.flush();\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ## Setting HTTP Headers\n     *\n     * The $http service will automatically add certain HTTP headers to all requests. These defaults\n     * can be fully configured by accessing the `$httpProvider.defaults.headers` configuration\n     * object, which currently contains this default configuration:\n     *\n     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.common` (headers that are common for all requests):\n     *   - <code>Accept: application/json, text/plain, \\*&#65279;/&#65279;\\*</code>\n     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.post`: (header defaults for POST requests)\n     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`\n     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.put` (header defaults for PUT requests)\n     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`\n     *\n     * To add or overwrite these defaults, simply add or remove a property from these configuration\n     * objects. To add headers for an HTTP method other than POST or PUT, simply add a new object\n     * with the lowercased HTTP method name as the key, e.g.\n     * `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.get = { 'My-Header' : 'value' }`.\n     *\n     * The defaults can also be set at runtime via the `$http.defaults` object in the same\n     * fashion. For example:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * module.run(function($http) {\n     *   $http.defaults.headers.common.Authorization = 'Basic YmVlcDpib29w';\n     * });\n     * ```\n     *\n     * In addition, you can supply a `headers` property in the config object passed when\n     * calling `$http(config)`, which overrides the defaults without changing them globally.\n     *\n     * To explicitly remove a header automatically added via $httpProvider.defaults.headers on a per request basis,\n     * Use the `headers` property, setting the desired header to `undefined`. For example:\n     *\n     * ```js\n     * var req = {\n     *  method: 'POST',\n     *  url: 'http://example.com',\n     *  headers: {\n     *    'Content-Type': undefined\n     *  },\n     *  data: { test: 'test' }\n     * }\n     *\n     * $http(req).then(function(){...}, function(){...});\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ## Transforming Requests and Responses\n     *\n     * Both requests and responses can be transformed using transformation functions: `transformRequest`\n     * and `transformResponse`. These properties can be a single function that returns\n     * the transformed value (`function(data, headersGetter, status)`) or an array of such transformation functions,\n     * which allows you to `push` or `unshift` a new transformation function into the transformation chain.\n     *\n     * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n     * **Note:** Angular does not make a copy of the `data` parameter before it is passed into the `transformRequest` pipeline.\n     * That means changes to the properties of `data` are not local to the transform function (since Javascript passes objects by reference).\n     * For example, when calling `$http.get(url, $scope.myObject)`, modifications to the object's properties in a transformRequest\n     * function will be reflected on the scope and in any templates where the object is data-bound.\n     * To prevent this, transform functions should have no side-effects.\n     * If you need to modify properties, it is recommended to make a copy of the data, or create new object to return.\n     * </div>\n     *\n     * ### Default Transformations\n     *\n     * The `$httpProvider` provider and `$http` service expose `defaults.transformRequest` and\n     * `defaults.transformResponse` properties. If a request does not provide its own transformations\n     * then these will be applied.\n     *\n     * You can augment or replace the default transformations by modifying these properties by adding to or\n     * replacing the array.\n     *\n     * Angular provides the following default transformations:\n     *\n     * Request transformations (`$httpProvider.defaults.transformRequest` and `$http.defaults.transformRequest`) is\n     * an array with one function that does the following:\n     *\n     * - If the `data` property of the request configuration object contains an object, serialize it\n     *   into JSON format.\n     *\n     * Response transformations (`$httpProvider.defaults.transformResponse` and `$http.defaults.transformResponse`) is\n     * an array with one function that does the following:\n     *\n     *  - If XSRF prefix is detected, strip it (see Security Considerations section below).\n     *  - If the `Content-Type` is `application/json` or the response looks like JSON,\n   *      deserialize it using a JSON parser.\n     *\n     *\n     * ### Overriding the Default Transformations Per Request\n     *\n     * If you wish to override the request/response transformations only for a single request then provide\n     * `transformRequest` and/or `transformResponse` properties on the configuration object passed\n     * into `$http`.\n     *\n     * Note that if you provide these properties on the config object the default transformations will be\n     * overwritten. If you wish to augment the default transformations then you must include them in your\n     * local transformation array.\n     *\n     * The following code demonstrates adding a new response transformation to be run after the default response\n     * transformations have been run.\n     *\n     * ```js\n     * function appendTransform(defaults, transform) {\n     *\n     *   // We can't guarantee that the default transformation is an array\n     *   defaults = angular.isArray(defaults) ? defaults : [defaults];\n     *\n     *   // Append the new transformation to the defaults\n     *   return defaults.concat(transform);\n     * }\n     *\n     * $http({\n     *   url: '...',\n     *   method: 'GET',\n     *   transformResponse: appendTransform($http.defaults.transformResponse, function(value) {\n     *     return doTransform(value);\n     *   })\n     * });\n     * ```\n     *\n     *\n     * ## Caching\n     *\n     * {@link ng.$http `$http`} responses are not cached by default. To enable caching, you must\n     * set the config.cache value or the default cache value to TRUE or to a cache object (created\n     * with {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}). If defined, the value of config.cache takes\n     * precedence over the default cache value.\n     *\n     * In order to:\n     *   * cache all responses - set the default cache value to TRUE or to a cache object\n     *   * cache a specific response - set config.cache value to TRUE or to a cache object\n     *\n     * If caching is enabled, but neither the default cache nor config.cache are set to a cache object,\n     * then the default `$cacheFactory(\"$http\")` object is used.\n     *\n     * The default cache value can be set by updating the\n     * {@link ng.$http#defaults `$http.defaults.cache`} property or the\n     * {@link $httpProvider#defaults `$httpProvider.defaults.cache`} property.\n     *\n     * When caching is enabled, {@link ng.$http `$http`} stores the response from the server using\n     * the relevant cache object. The next time the same request is made, the response is returned\n     * from the cache without sending a request to the server.\n     *\n     * Take note that:\n     *\n     *   * Only GET and JSONP requests are cached.\n     *   * The cache key is the request URL including search parameters; headers are not considered.\n     *   * Cached responses are returned asynchronously, in the same way as responses from the server.\n     *   * If multiple identical requests are made using the same cache, which is not yet populated,\n     *     one request will be made to the server and remaining requests will return the same response.\n     *   * A cache-control header on the response does not affect if or how responses are cached.\n     *\n     *\n     * ## Interceptors\n     *\n     * Before you start creating interceptors, be sure to understand the\n     * {@link ng.$q $q and deferred/promise APIs}.\n     *\n     * For purposes of global error handling, authentication, or any kind of synchronous or\n     * asynchronous pre-processing of request or postprocessing of responses, it is desirable to be\n     * able to intercept requests before they are handed to the server and\n     * responses before they are handed over to the application code that\n     * initiated these requests. The interceptors leverage the {@link ng.$q\n     * promise APIs} to fulfill this need for both synchronous and asynchronous pre-processing.\n     *\n     * The interceptors are service factories that are registered with the `$httpProvider` by\n     * adding them to the `$httpProvider.interceptors` array. The factory is called and\n     * injected with dependencies (if specified) and returns the interceptor.\n     *\n     * There are two kinds of interceptors (and two kinds of rejection interceptors):\n     *\n     *   * `request`: interceptors get called with a http {@link $http#usage config} object. The function is free to\n     *     modify the `config` object or create a new one. The function needs to return the `config`\n     *     object directly, or a promise containing the `config` or a new `config` object.\n     *   * `requestError`: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or\n     *     resolved with a rejection.\n     *   * `response`: interceptors get called with http `response` object. The function is free to\n     *     modify the `response` object or create a new one. The function needs to return the `response`\n     *     object directly, or as a promise containing the `response` or a new `response` object.\n     *   * `responseError`: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or\n     *     resolved with a rejection.\n     *\n     *\n     * ```js\n     *   // register the interceptor as a service\n     *   $provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {\n     *     return {\n     *       // optional method\n     *       'request': function(config) {\n     *         // do something on success\n     *         return config;\n     *       },\n     *\n     *       // optional method\n     *      'requestError': function(rejection) {\n     *         // do something on error\n     *         if (canRecover(rejection)) {\n     *           return responseOrNewPromise\n     *         }\n     *         return $q.reject(rejection);\n     *       },\n     *\n     *\n     *\n     *       // optional method\n     *       'response': function(response) {\n     *         // do something on success\n     *         return response;\n     *       },\n     *\n     *       // optional method\n     *      'responseError': function(rejection) {\n     *         // do something on error\n     *         if (canRecover(rejection)) {\n     *           return responseOrNewPromise\n     *         }\n     *         return $q.reject(rejection);\n     *       }\n     *     };\n     *   });\n     *\n     *   $httpProvider.interceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');\n     *\n     *\n     *   // alternatively, register the interceptor via an anonymous factory\n     *   $httpProvider.interceptors.push(function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {\n     *     return {\n     *      'request': function(config) {\n     *          // same as above\n     *       },\n     *\n     *       'response': function(response) {\n     *          // same as above\n     *       }\n     *     };\n     *   });\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ## Security Considerations\n     *\n     * When designing web applications, consider security threats from:\n     *\n     * - [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)\n     * - [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)\n     *\n     * Both server and the client must cooperate in order to eliminate these threats. Angular comes\n     * pre-configured with strategies that address these issues, but for this to work backend server\n     * cooperation is required.\n     *\n     * ### JSON Vulnerability Protection\n     *\n     * A [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)\n     * allows third party website to turn your JSON resource URL into\n     * [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) request under some conditions. To\n     * counter this your server can prefix all JSON requests with following string `\")]}',\\n\"`.\n     * Angular will automatically strip the prefix before processing it as JSON.\n     *\n     * For example if your server needs to return:\n     * ```js\n     * ['one','two']\n     * ```\n     *\n     * which is vulnerable to attack, your server can return:\n     * ```js\n     * )]}',\n     * ['one','two']\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Angular will strip the prefix, before processing the JSON.\n     *\n     *\n     * ### Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF) Protection\n     *\n     * [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) is an attack technique by\n     * which the attacker can trick an authenticated user into unknowingly executing actions on your\n     * website. Angular provides a mechanism to counter XSRF. When performing XHR requests, the\n     * $http service reads a token from a cookie (by default, `XSRF-TOKEN`) and sets it as an HTTP\n     * header (`X-XSRF-TOKEN`). Since only JavaScript that runs on your domain could read the\n     * cookie, your server can be assured that the XHR came from JavaScript running on your domain.\n     * The header will not be set for cross-domain requests.\n     *\n     * To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a JavaScript readable session\n     * cookie called `XSRF-TOKEN` on the first HTTP GET request. On subsequent XHR requests the\n     * server can verify that the cookie matches `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header, and therefore be sure\n     * that only JavaScript running on your domain could have sent the request. The token must be\n     * unique for each user and must be verifiable by the server (to prevent the JavaScript from\n     * making up its own tokens). We recommend that the token is a digest of your site's\n     * authentication cookie with a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography&#41;)\n     * for added security.\n     *\n     * The name of the headers can be specified using the xsrfHeaderName and xsrfCookieName\n     * properties of either $httpProvider.defaults at config-time, $http.defaults at run-time,\n     * or the per-request config object.\n     *\n     * In order to prevent collisions in environments where multiple Angular apps share the\n     * same domain or subdomain, we recommend that each application uses unique cookie name.\n     *\n     * @param {object} config Object describing the request to be made and how it should be\n     *    processed. The object has following properties:\n     *\n     *    - **method** – `{string}` – HTTP method (e.g. 'GET', 'POST', etc)\n     *    - **url** – `{string|TrustedObject}` – Absolute or relative URL of the resource that is being requested;\n     *      or an object created by a call to `$sce.trustAsResourceUrl(url)`.\n     *    - **params** – `{Object.<string|Object>}` – Map of strings or objects which will be serialized\n     *      with the `paramSerializer` and appended as GET parameters.\n     *    - **data** – `{string|Object}` – Data to be sent as the request message data.\n     *    - **headers** – `{Object}` – Map of strings or functions which return strings representing\n     *      HTTP headers to send to the server. If the return value of a function is null, the\n     *      header will not be sent. Functions accept a config object as an argument.\n     *    - **eventHandlers** - `{Object}` - Event listeners to be bound to the XMLHttpRequest object.\n     *      To bind events to the XMLHttpRequest upload object, use `uploadEventHandlers`.\n     *      The handler will be called in the context of a `$apply` block.\n     *    - **uploadEventHandlers** - `{Object}` - Event listeners to be bound to the XMLHttpRequest upload\n     *      object. To bind events to the XMLHttpRequest object, use `eventHandlers`.\n     *      The handler will be called in the context of a `$apply` block.\n     *    - **xsrfHeaderName** – `{string}` – Name of HTTP header to populate with the XSRF token.\n     *    - **xsrfCookieName** – `{string}` – Name of cookie containing the XSRF token.\n     *    - **transformRequest** –\n     *      `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –\n     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http\n     *      request body and headers and returns its transformed (typically serialized) version.\n     *      See {@link ng.$http#overriding-the-default-transformations-per-request\n     *      Overriding the Default Transformations}\n     *    - **transformResponse** –\n     *      `{function(data, headersGetter, status)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter, status)>}` –\n     *      transform function or an array of such functions.

So, for HTML elements interpolated\n     * by {@link ng.$compile $compile}, or otherwise interpolated with the `mustHaveExpression` parameter\n     * set to `true`, the interpolated text must contain an unescaped interpolation expression. As such,\n     * this is typically useful only when user-data is used in rendering a template from the server, or\n     * when otherwise untrusted data is used by a directive.\n     *\n     * <example name=\"interpolation\">\n     *  <file name=\"index.html\">\n     *    <div ng-init=\"username='A user'\">\n     *      <p ng-init=\"apptitle='Escaping demo'\">{{apptitle}}: \\{\\{ username = \"defaced value\"; \\}\\}\n     *        </p>\n     *      <p><strong>{{username}}</strong> attempts to inject code which will deface the\n     *        application, but fails to accomplish their task, because the server has correctly\n     *        escaped the interpolation start/end markers with REVERSE SOLIDUS U+005C (backslash)\n     *        characters.</p>\n     *      <p>Instead, the result of the attempted script injection is visible, and can be removed\n     *        from the database by an administrator.</p>\n     *    </div>\n     *  </file>\n     * </example>\n     *\n     * @knownIssue\n     * It is currently not possible for an interpolated expression to contain the interpolation end\n     * symbol. For example, `{{ '}}' }}` will be incorrectly interpreted as `{{ ' }}` + `' }}`, i.e.\n     * an interpolated expression consisting of a single-quote (`'`) and the `' }}` string.\n     *\n     * @knownIssue\n     * All directives and components must use the standard `{{` `}}` interpolation symbols\n     * in their templates. If you change the application interpolation symbols the {@link $compile}\n     * service will attempt to denormalize the standard symbols to the custom symbols.\n     * The denormalization process is not clever enough to know not to replace instances of the standard\n     * symbols where they would not normally be treated as interpolation symbols. For example in the following\n     * code snippet the closing braces of the literal object will get incorrectly denormalized:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * <div data-context='{\"context\":{\"id\":3,\"type\":\"page\"}}\">\n     * ```\n     *\n     * The workaround is to ensure that such instances are separated by whitespace:\n     * ```\n     * <div data-context='{\"context\":{\"id\":3,\"type\":\"page\"} }\">\n     * ```\n     *\n     * See https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14610#issuecomment-219401099 for more information.\n     *\n     * @param {string} text The text with markup to interpolate.\n     * @param {boolean=} mustHaveExpression if set to true then the interpolation string must have\n     *    embedded expression in order to return an interpolation function. Strings with no\n     *    embedded expression will return null for the interpolation function.\n     * @param {string=} trustedContext when provided, the returned function passes the interpolated\n     *    result through {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted(interpolatedResult,\n     *    trustedContext)} before returning it.

This is similar to the native Promise implementation from ES6,\n * see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).\n *\n * While the constructor-style use is supported, not all of the supporting methods from ES6 promises are\n * available yet.\n *\n * It can be used like so:\n *\n * ```js\n *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `okToGreet`\n *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).\n *\n *   function asyncGreet(name) {\n *     // perform some asynchronous operation, resolve or reject the promise when appropriate.\n *     return $q(function(resolve, reject) {\n *       setTimeout(function() {\n *         if (okToGreet(name)) {\n *           resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');\n *         } else {\n *           reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');\n *         }\n *       }, 1000);\n *     });\n *   }\n *\n *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');\n *   promise.then(function(greeting) {\n *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);\n *   }, function(reason) {\n *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);\n *   });\n * ```\n *\n * Note: progress/notify callbacks are not currently supported via the ES6-style interface.\n *\n * Note: unlike ES6 behavior, an exception thrown in the constructor function will NOT implicitly reject the promise.\n *\n * However, the more traditional CommonJS-style usage is still available, and documented below.\n *\n * [The CommonJS Promise proposal](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises) describes a promise as an\n * interface for interacting with an object that represents the result of an action that is\n * performed asynchronously, and may or may not be finished at any given point in time.\n *\n * From the perspective of dealing with error handling, deferred and promise APIs are to\n * asynchronous programming what `try`, `catch` and `throw` keywords are to synchronous programming.\n *\n * ```js\n *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `okToGreet`\n *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).\n *\n *   function asyncGreet(name) {\n *     var deferred = $q.defer();\n *\n *     setTimeout(function() {\n *       deferred.notify('About to greet ' + name + '.');\n *\n *       if (okToGreet(name)) {\n *         deferred.resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');\n *       } else {\n *         deferred.reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');\n *       }\n *     }, 1000);\n *\n *     return deferred.promise;\n *   }\n *\n *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');\n *   promise.then(function(greeting) {\n *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);\n *   }, function(reason) {\n *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);\n *   }, function(update) {\n *     alert('Got notification: ' + update);\n *   });\n * ```\n *\n * At first it might not be obvious why this extra complexity is worth the trouble. The payoff\n * comes in the way of guarantees that promise and deferred APIs make, see\n * https://github.com/kriskowal/uncommonjs/blob/master/promises/specification.md.\n *\n * Additionally the promise api allows for composition that is very hard to do with the\n * traditional callback ([CPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)) approach.\n * For more on this please see the [Q documentation](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) especially the\n * section on serial or parallel joining of promises.\n *\n * ## The Deferred API\n *\n * A new instance of deferred is constructed by calling `$q.defer()`.\n *\n * The purpose of the deferred object is to expose the associated Promise instance as well as APIs\n * that can be used for signaling the successful or unsuccessful completion, as well as the status\n * of the task.\n *\n * **Methods**\n *\n * - `resolve(value)` – resolves the derived promise with the `value`. If the value is a rejection\n *   constructed via `$q.reject`, the promise will be rejected instead.\n * - `reject(reason)` – rejects the derived promise with the `reason`. This is equivalent to\n *   resolving it with a rejection constructed via `$q.reject`.\n * - `notify(value)` - provides updates on the status of the promise's execution. This may be called\n *   multiple times before the promise is either resolved or rejected.\n *\n * **Properties**\n *\n * - promise – `{Promise}` – promise object associated with this deferred.\n *\n *\n * ## The Promise API\n *\n * A new promise instance is created when a deferred instance is created and can be retrieved by\n * calling `deferred.promise`.\n *\n * The purpose of the promise object is to allow for interested parties to get access to the result\n * of the deferred task when it completes.\n *\n * **Methods**\n *\n * - `then(successCallback, [errorCallback], [notifyCallback])` – regardless of when the promise was or\n *   will be resolved or rejected, `then` calls one of the success or error callbacks asynchronously\n *   as soon as the result is available. The callbacks are called with a single argument: the result\n *   or rejection reason. Additionally, the notify callback may be called zero or more times to\n *   provide a progress indication, before the promise is resolved or rejected.\n *\n *   This method *returns a new promise* which is resolved or rejected via the return value of the\n *   `successCallback`, `errorCallback` (unless that value is a promise, in which case it is resolved\n *   with the value which is resolved in that promise using\n *   [promise chaining](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/#toc-promises-queues)).\n *   It also notifies via the return value of the `notifyCallback` method. The promise cannot be\n *   resolved or rejected from the notifyCallback method. The errorCallback and notifyCallback\n *   arguments are optional.\n *\n * - `catch(errorCallback)` – shorthand for `promise.then(null, errorCallback)`\n *\n * - `finally(callback, notifyCallback)` – allows you to observe either the fulfillment or rejection of a promise,\n *   but to do so without modifying the final value. This is useful to release resources or do some\n *   clean-up that needs to be done whether the promise was rejected or resolved. See the [full\n *   specification](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promisefinallycallback) for\n *   more information.\n *\n * ## Chaining promises\n *\n * Because calling the `then` method of a promise returns a new derived promise, it is easily\n * possible to create a chain of promises:\n *\n * ```js\n *   promiseB = promiseA.then(function(result) {\n *     return result + 1;\n *   });\n *\n *   // promiseB will be resolved immediately after promiseA is resolved and its value\n *   // will be the result of promiseA incremented by 1\n * ```\n *\n * It is possible to create chains of any length and since a promise can be resolved with another\n * promise (which will defer its resolution further), it is possible to pause/defer resolution of\n * the promises at any point in the chain. This makes it possible to implement powerful APIs like\n * $http's response interceptors.\n *\n *\n * ## Differences between Kris Kowal's Q and $q\n *\n *  There are two main differences:\n *\n * - $q is integrated with the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope} Scope model observation\n *   mechanism in angular, which means faster propagation of resolution or rejection into your\n *   models and avoiding unnecessary browser repaints, which would result in flickering UI.\n * - Q has many more features than $q, but that comes at a cost of bytes. $q is tiny, but contains\n *   all the important functionality needed for common async tasks.\n *\n * ## Testing\n *\n *  ```js\n *    it('should simulate promise', inject(function($q, $rootScope) {\n *      var deferred = $q.defer();\n *      var promise = deferred.promise;\n *      var resolvedValue;\n *\n *      promise.then(function(value) { resolvedValue = value; });\n *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();\n *\n *      // Simulate resolving of promise\n *      deferred.resolve(123);\n *      // Note that the 'then' function does not get called synchronously.\n *      // This is because we want the promise API to always be async, whether or not\n *      // it got called synchronously or asynchronously.\n *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();\n *\n *      // Propagate promise resolution to 'then' functions using $apply().\n *      $rootScope.$apply();\n *      expect(resolvedValue).toEqual(123);\n *    }));\n *  ```\n *\n * @param {function(function, function)} resolver Function which is responsible for resolving or\n *   rejecting the newly created promise. The first parameter is a function which resolves the\n *   promise, the second parameter is a function which rejects the promise.\n *\n * @returns {Promise} The newly created promise.\n */\n/**\n * @ngdoc provider\n * @name $qProvider\n * @this\n *\n * @description\n */\nfunction $QProvider() {\n  var errorOnUnhandledRejections = true;\n  this.$get = ['$rootScope', '$exceptionHandler', function($rootScope, $exceptionHandler) {\n    return qFactory(function(callback) {\n      $rootScope.$evalAsync(callback);\n    }, $exceptionHandler, errorOnUnhandledRejections);\n  }];\n\n  /**\n   * @ngdoc method\n   * @name $qProvider#errorOnUnhandledRejections\n   * @kind function\n   *\n   * @description\n   * Retrieves or overrides whether to generate an error when a rejected promise is not handled.\n   * This feature is enabled by default.\n   *\n   * @param {boolean=} value Whether to generate an error when a rejected promise is not handled.\n   * @returns {boolean|ng.$qProvider} Current value when called without a new value or self for\n   *    chaining otherwise.\n   */\n  this.errorOnUnhandledRejections = function(value) {\n    if (isDefined(value)) {\n      errorOnUnhandledRejections = value;\n      return this;\n    } else {\n      return errorOnUnhandledRejections;\n    }\n  };\n}\n\n/** @this */\nfunction $$QProvider() {\n  var errorOnUnhandledRejections = true;\n  this.$get = ['$browser', '$exceptionHandler', function($browser, $exceptionHandler) {\n    return qFactory(function(callback) {\n      $browser.defer(callback);\n    }, $exceptionHandler, errorOnUnhandledRejections);\n  }];\n\n  this.errorOnUnhandledRejections = function(value) {\n    if (isDefined(value)) {\n      errorOnUnhandledRejections = value;\n      return this;\n    } else {\n      return errorOnUnhandledRejections;\n    }\n  };\n}\n\n/**\n * Constructs a promise manager.\n *\n * @param {function(function)} nextTick Function for executing functions in the next turn.\n * @param {function(...*)} exceptionHandler Function into which unexpected exceptions are passed for\n *     debugging purposes.\n * @param {boolean=} errorOnUnhandledRejections Whether an error should be generated on unhandled\n *     promises rejections.\n * @returns {object} Promise manager.\n */\nfunction qFactory(nextTick, exceptionHandler, errorOnUnhandledRejections) {\n  var $qMinErr = minErr('$q', TypeError);\n  var queueSize = 0;\n  var checkQueue = [];\n\n  /**\n   * @ngdoc method\n   * @name ng.$q#defer\n   * @kind function\n   *\n   * @description\n   * Creates a `Deferred` object which represents a task which will finish in the future.\n   *\n   * @returns {Deferred} Returns a new instance of deferred.\n   */\n  function defer() {\n    return new Deferred();\n  }\n\n  function Deferred() {\n    var promise = this.promise = new Promise();\n    //Non prototype methods necessary to support unbound execution :/\n    this.resolve = function(val) { resolvePromise(promise, val);

Its goal is to assist in writing code in a way that (a) is secure by default, and\n * (b) makes auditing for security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, etc. a lot easier.\n *\n * ### Overview\n *\n * To systematically block XSS security bugs, AngularJS treats all values as untrusted by default in\n * HTML or sensitive URL bindings. When binding untrusted values, AngularJS will automatically\n * run security checks on them (sanitizations, whitelists, depending on context), or throw when it\n * cannot guarantee the security of the result. That behavior depends strongly on contexts: HTML\n * can be sanitized, but template URLs cannot, for instance.\n *\n * To illustrate this, consider the `ng-bind-html` directive. It renders its value directly as HTML:\n * we call that the *context*. When given an untrusted input, AngularJS will attempt to sanitize it\n * before rendering if a sanitizer is available, and throw otherwise. To bypass sanitization and\n * render the input as-is, you will need to mark it as trusted for that context before attempting\n * to bind it.\n *\n * As of version 1.2, AngularJS ships with SCE enabled by default.\n *\n * ### In practice\n *\n * Here's an example of a binding in a privileged context:\n *\n * ```\n * <input ng-model=\"userHtml\" aria-label=\"User input\">\n * <div ng-bind-html=\"userHtml\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that `ng-bind-html` is bound to `userHtml` controlled by the user.  With SCE\n * disabled, this application allows the user to render arbitrary HTML into the DIV, which would\n * be an XSS security bug. In a more realistic example, one may be rendering user comments, blog\n * articles, etc. via bindings. (HTML is just one example of a context where rendering user\n * controlled input creates security vulnerabilities.)\n *\n * For the case of HTML, you might use a library, either on the client side, or on the server side,\n * to sanitize unsafe HTML before binding to the value and rendering it in the document.\n *\n * How would you ensure that every place that used these types of bindings was bound to a value that\n * was sanitized by your library (or returned as safe for rendering by your server?)  How can you\n * ensure that you didn't accidentally delete the line that sanitized the value, or renamed some\n * properties/fields and forgot to update the binding to the sanitized value?\n *\n * To be secure by default, AngularJS makes sure bindings go through that sanitization, or\n * any similar validation process, unless there's a good reason to trust the given value in this\n * context.  That trust is formalized with a function call. This means that as a developer, you\n * can assume all untrusted bindings are safe. Then, to audit your code for binding security issues,\n * you just need to ensure the values you mark as trusted indeed are safe - because they were\n * received from your server, sanitized by your library, etc. You can organize your codebase to\n * help with this - perhaps allowing only the files in a specific directory to do this.\n * Ensuring that the internal API exposed by that code doesn't markup arbitrary values as safe then\n * becomes a more manageable task.\n *\n * In the case of AngularJS' SCE service, one uses {@link ng.$sce#trustAs $sce.trustAs}\n * (and shorthand methods such as {@link ng.$sce#trustAsHtml $sce.trustAsHtml}, etc.) to\n * build the trusted versions of your values.\n *\n * ### How does it work?\n *\n * In privileged contexts, directives and code will bind to the result of {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted\n * $sce.getTrusted(context, value)} rather than to the value directly.  Think of this function as\n * a way to enforce the required security context in your data sink. Directives use {@link\n * ng.$sce#parseAs $sce.parseAs} rather than `$parse` to watch attribute bindings, which performs\n * the {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted} behind the scenes on non-constant literals. Also,\n * when binding without directives, AngularJS will understand the context of your bindings\n * automatically.\n *\n * As an example, {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} uses {@link\n * ng.$sce#parseAsHtml $sce.parseAsHtml(binding expression)}.  Here's the actual code (slightly\n * simplified):\n *\n * ```\n * var ngBindHtmlDirective = ['$sce', function($sce) {\n *   return function(scope, element, attr) {\n *     scope.$watch($sce.parseAsHtml(attr.ngBindHtml), function(value) {\n *       element.html(value || '');\n *     });\n *   };\n * }];\n * ```\n *\n * ### Impact on loading templates\n *\n * This applies both to the {@link ng.directive:ngInclude `ng-include`} directive as well as\n * `templateUrl`'s specified by {@link guide/directive directives}.\n *\n * By default, Angular only loads templates from the same domain and protocol as the application\n * document.  This is done by calling {@link ng.$sce#getTrustedResourceUrl\n * $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl} on the template URL.  To load templates from other domains and/or\n * protocols, you may either {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelist\n * them} or {@link ng.$sce#trustAsResourceUrl wrap it} into a trusted value.\n *\n * *Please note*:\n * The browser's\n * [Same Origin Policy](https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest)\n * and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)\n * policy apply in addition to this and may further restrict whether the template is successfully\n * loaded.  This means that without the right CORS policy, loading templates from a different domain\n * won't work on all browsers.  Also, loading templates from `file://` URL does not work on some\n * browsers.\n *\n * ### This feels like too much overhead\n *\n * It's important to remember that SCE only applies to interpolation expressions.\n *\n * If your expressions are constant literals, they're automatically trusted and you don't need to\n * call `$sce.trustAs` on them (e.g.\n * `<div ng-bind-html=\"'<b>implicitly trusted</b>'\"></div>`) just works. The `$sceDelegate` will\n * also use the `$sanitize` service if it is available when binding untrusted values to\n * `$sce.HTML` context. AngularJS provides an implementation in `angular-sanitize.js`, and if you\n * wish to use it, you will also need to depend on the {@link ngSanitize `ngSanitize`} module in\n * your application.\n *\n * The included {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} comes with sane defaults to allow you to load\n * templates in `ng-include` from your application's domain without having to even know about SCE.\n * It blocks loading templates from other domains or loading templates over http from an https\n * served document.  You can change these by setting your own custom {@link\n * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelists} and {@link\n * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist blacklists} for matching such URLs.\n *\n * This significantly reduces the overhead.  It is far easier to pay the small overhead and have an\n * application that's secure and can be audited to verify that with much more ease than bolting\n * security onto an application later.\n *\n * <a name=\"contexts\"></a>\n * ### What trusted context types are supported?\n *\n * | Context             | Notes          |\n * |---------------------|----------------|\n * | `$sce.HTML`         | For HTML that's safe to source into the application.  The {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} directive uses this context for bindings. If an unsafe value is encountered, and the {@link ngSanitize.$sanitize $sanitize} service is available (implemented by the {@link ngSanitize ngSanitize} module) this will sanitize the value instead of throwing an error. |\n * | `$sce.CSS`          | For CSS that's safe to source into the application.  Currently, no bindings require this context. Feel free to use it in your own directives. |\n * | `$sce.URL`          | For URLs that are safe to follow as links.  Currently unused (`<a href=`, `<img src=`, and some others sanitize their urls and don't constitute an SCE context.) |\n * | `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` | For URLs that are not only safe to follow as links, but whose contents are also safe to include in your application.  Examples include `ng-include`, `src` / `ngSrc` bindings for tags other than `IMG`, `VIDEO`, `AUDIO`, `SOURCE`, and `TRACK` (e.g. `IFRAME`, `OBJECT`, etc.)  <br><br>Note that `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` makes a stronger statement about the URL than `$sce.URL` does (it's not just the URL that matters, but also what is at the end of it), and therefore contexts requiring values trusted for `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` can be used anywhere that values trusted for `$sce.URL` are required. |\n * | `$sce.JS`           | For JavaScript that is safe to execute in your application's context.  Currently, no bindings require this context.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |\n *\n *\n * Be aware that `a[href]` and `img[src]` automatically sanitize their URLs and do not pass them\n * through {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted}. There's no CSS-, URL-, or JS-context bindings\n * in AngularJS currently, so their corresponding `$sce.trustAs` functions aren't useful yet. This\n * might evolve.\n *\n * ### Format of items in {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist resourceUrlWhitelist}/{@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist Blacklist} <a name=\"resourceUrlPatternItem\"></a>\n *\n *  Each element in these arrays must be one of the following:\n *\n *  - **'self'**\n *    - The special **string**, `'self'`, can be used to match against all URLs of the **same\n *      domain** as the application document using the **same protocol**.\n *  - **String** (except the special value `'self'`)\n *    - The string is matched against the full *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource\n *      being tested (substring matches are not good enough.)\n *    - There are exactly **two wildcard sequences** - `*` and `**`.  All other characters\n *      match themselves.\n *    - `*`: matches zero or more occurrences of any character other than one of the following 6\n *      characters: '`:`', '`/`', '`.`', '`?`', '`&`' and '`;`'.  It's a useful wildcard for use\n *      in a whitelist.\n *    - `**`: matches zero or more occurrences of *any* character.  As such, it's not\n *      appropriate for use in a scheme, domain, etc. as it would match too much.  (e.g.\n *      http://**.example.com/ would match http://evil.com/?ignore=.example.com/ and that might\n *      not have been the intention.)  Its usage at the very end of the path is ok.  (e.g.\n *      http://foo.example.com/templates/**).\n *  - **RegExp** (*see caveat below*)\n *    - *Caveat*:  While regular expressions are powerful and offer great flexibility,  their syntax\n *      (and all the inevitable escaping) makes them *harder to maintain*.  It's easy to\n *      accidentally introduce a bug when one updates a complex expression (imho, all regexes should\n *      have good test coverage).  For instance, the use of `.` in the regex is correct only in a\n *      small number of cases.  A `.` character in the regex used when matching the scheme or a\n *      subdomain could be matched against a `:` or literal `.` that was likely not intended.   It\n *      is highly recommended to use the string patterns and only fall back to regular expressions\n *      as a last resort.\n *    - The regular expression must be an instance of RegExp (i.e. not a string.)  It is\n *      matched against the **entire** *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource being tested\n *      (even when the RegExp did not have the `^` and `$` codes.)  In addition, any flags\n *      present on the RegExp (such as multiline, global, ignoreCase) are ignored.\n *    - If you are generating your JavaScript from some other templating engine (not\n *      recommended, e.g. in issue [#4006](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4006)),\n *      remember to escape your regular expression (and be aware that you might need more than\n *      one level of escaping depending on your templating engine and the way you interpolated\n *      the value.)  Do make use of your platform's escaping mechanism as it might be good\n *      enough before coding your own.  E.g. Ruby has\n *      [Regexp.escape(str)](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Regexp.html#method-c-escape)\n *      and Python has [re.escape](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.escape).\n *      Javascript lacks a similar built in function for escaping.  Take a look at Google\n *      Closure library's [goog.string.regExpEscape(s)](\n *      http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/closure_goog_string_string.js.source.html#line962).\n *\n * Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} for an example.\n *\n * ### Show me an example using SCE.\n *\n * <example module=\"mySceApp\" deps=\"angular-sanitize.js\" name=\"sce-service\">\n * <file name=\"index.html\">\n *   <div ng-controller=\"AppController as myCtrl\">\n *     <i ng-bind-html=\"myCtrl.explicitlyTrustedHtml\" id=\"explicitlyTrustedHtml\"></i><br><br>\n *     <b>User comments</b><br>\n *     By default, HTML that isn't explicitly trusted (e.g. Alice's comment) is sanitized when\n *     $sanitize is available.

However, this is strongly discouraged.  SCE gives you a lot of security benefits\n * for little coding overhead.  It will be much harder to take an SCE disabled application and\n * either secure it on your own or enable SCE at a later stage.  It might make sense to disable SCE\n * for cases where you have a lot of existing code that was written before SCE was introduced and\n * you're migrating them a module at a time. Also do note that this is an app-wide setting, so if\n * you are writing a library, you will cause security bugs applications using it.\n *\n * That said, here's how you can completely disable SCE:\n *\n * ```\n * angular.module('myAppWithSceDisabledmyApp', []).config(function($sceProvider) {\n *   // Completely disable SCE.  For demonstration purposes only!\n *   // Do not use in new projects or libraries.\n *   $sceProvider.enabled(false);\n * });\n * ```\n *\n */\n\nfunction $SceProvider() {\n  var enabled = true;\n\n  /**\n   * @ngdoc method\n   * @name $sceProvider#enabled\n   * @kind function\n   *\n   * @param {boolean=} value If provided, then enables/disables SCE application-wide.\n   * @return {boolean} True if SCE is enabled, false otherwise.\n   *\n   * @description\n   * Enables/disables SCE and returns the current value.\n   */\n  this.enabled = function(value) {\n    if (arguments.length) {\n      enabled = !!value;\n    }\n    return enabled;\n  };\n\n\n  /* Design notes on the default implementation for SCE.\n   *\n   * The API contract for the SCE delegate\n   * -------------------------------------\n   * The SCE delegate object must provide the following 3 methods:\n   *\n   * - trustAs(contextEnum, value)\n   *     This method is used to tell the SCE service that the provided value is OK to use in the\n   *     contexts specified by contextEnum.  It must return an object that will be accepted by\n   *     getTrusted() for a compatible contextEnum and return this value.\n   *\n   * - valueOf(value)\n   *     For values that were not produced by trustAs(), return them as is.  For values that were\n   *     produced by trustAs(), return the corresponding input value to trustAs.  Basically, if\n   *     trustAs is wrapping the given values into some type, this operation unwraps it when given\n   *     such a value.\n   *\n   * - getTrusted(contextEnum, value)\n   *     This function should return the a value that is safe to use in the context specified by\n   *     contextEnum or throw and exception otherwise.\n   *\n   * NOTE: This contract deliberately does NOT state that values returned by trustAs() must be\n   * opaque or wrapped in some holder object.  That happens to be an implementation detail.  For\n   * instance, an implementation could maintain a registry of all trusted objects by context.  In\n   * such a case, trustAs() would return the same object that was passed in.  getTrusted() would\n   * return the same object passed in if it was found in the registry under a compatible context or\n   * throw an exception otherwise.  An implementation might only wrap values some of the time based\n   * on some criteria.  getTrusted() might return a value and not throw an exception for special\n   * constants or objects even if not wrapped.  All such implementations fulfill this contract.\n   *\n   *\n   * A note on the inheritance model for SCE contexts\n   * ------------------------------------------------\n   * I've used inheritance and made RESOURCE_URL wrapped types a subtype of URL wrapped types.  This\n   * is purely an implementation details.\n   *\n   * The contract is simply this:\n   *\n   *     getTrusted($sce.RESOURCE_URL, value) succeeding implies that getTrusted($sce.URL, value)\n   *     will also succeed.\n   *\n   * Inheritance happens to capture this in a natural way. In some future, we may not use\n   * inheritance anymore. That is OK because no code outside of sce.js and sceSpecs.js would need to\n   * be aware of this detail.\n   */\n\n  this.$get = ['$parse', '$sceDelegate', function(\n                $parse,   $sceDelegate) {\n    // Support: IE 9-11 only\n    // Prereq: Ensure that we're not running in IE<11 quirks mode.

Normalizing means that a relative\n * URL will be resolved into an absolute URL in the context of the application document.\n * Parsing means that the anchor node's host, hostname, protocol, port, pathname and related\n * properties are all populated to reflect the normalized URL.  This approach has wide\n * compatibility - Safari 1+, Mozilla 1+ etc.  See\n * http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html\n *\n * Implementation Notes for IE\n * ---------------------------\n * IE <= 10 normalizes the URL when assigned to the anchor node similar to the other\n * browsers.

All strings or\n *     objects with string properties in `array` that match this string will be returned. This also\n *     applies to nested object properties.\n *     The predicate can be negated by prefixing the string with `!`.\n *\n *   - `Object`: A pattern object can be used to filter specific properties on objects contained\n *     by `array`. For example `{name:\"M\", phone:\"1\"}` predicate will return an array of items\n *     which have property `name` containing \"M\" and property `phone` containing \"1\". A special\n *     property name (`$` by default) can be used (e.g. as in `{$: \"text\"}`) to accept a match\n *     against any property of the object or its nested object properties. That's equivalent to the\n *     simple substring match with a `string` as described above. The special property name can be\n *     overwritten, using the `anyPropertyKey` parameter.\n *     The predicate can be negated by prefixing the string with `!`.\n *     For example `{name: \"!M\"}` predicate will return an array of items which have property `name`\n *     not containing \"M\".\n *\n *     Note that a named property will match properties on the same level only, while the special\n *     `$` property will match properties on the same level or deeper. E.g. an array item like\n *     `{name: {first: 'John', last: 'Doe'}}` will **not** be matched by `{name: 'John'}`, but\n *     **will** be matched by `{$: 'John'}`.\n *\n *   - `function(value, index, array)`: A predicate function can be used to write arbitrary filters.\n *     The function is called for each element of the array, with the element, its index, and\n *     the entire array itself as arguments.\n *\n *     The final result is an array of those elements that the predicate returned true for.\n *\n * @param {function(actual, expected)|true|false} [comparator] Comparator which is used in\n *     determining if values retrieved using `expression` (when it is not a function) should be\n *     considered a match based on the expected value (from the filter expression) and actual\n *     value (from the object in the array).\n *\n *   Can be one of:\n *\n *   - `function(actual, expected)`:\n *     The function will be given the object value and the predicate value to compare and\n *     should return true if both values should be considered equal.\n *\n *   - `true`: A shorthand for `function(actual, expected) { return angular.equals(actual, expected)}`.\n *     This is essentially strict comparison of expected and actual.\n *\n *   - `false`: A short hand for a function which will look for a substring match in a case\n *     insensitive way. Primitive values are converted to strings. Objects are not compared against\n *     primitives, unless they have a custom `toString` method (e.g. `Date` objects).\n *\n *\n *   Defaults to `false`.\n *\n * @param {string} [anyPropertyKey] The special property name that matches against any property.\n *     By default `$`.\n *\n * @example\n   <example name=\"filter-filter\">\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <div ng-init=\"friends = [{name:'John', phone:'555-1276'},\n                                {name:'Mary', phone:'800-BIG-MARY'},\n                                {name:'Mike', phone:'555-4321'},\n                                {name:'Adam', phone:'555-5678'},\n                                {name:'Julie', phone:'555-8765'},\n                                {name:'Juliette', phone:'555-5678'}]\"></div>\n\n       <label>Search: <input ng-model=\"searchText\"></label>\n       <table id=\"searchTextResults\">\n         <tr><th>Name</th><th>Phone</th></tr>\n         <tr ng-repeat=\"friend in friends | filter:searchText\">\n           <td>{{friend.name}}</td>\n           <td>{{friend.phone}}</td>\n         </tr>\n       </table>\n       <hr>\n       <label>Any: <input ng-model=\"search.$\"></label> <br>\n       <label>Name only <input ng-model=\"search.name\"></label><br>\n       <label>Phone only <input ng-model=\"search.phone\"></label><br>\n       <label>Equality <input type=\"checkbox\" ng-model=\"strict\"></label><br>\n       <table id=\"searchObjResults\">\n         <tr><th>Name</th><th>Phone</th></tr>\n         <tr ng-repeat=\"friendObj in friends | filter:search:strict\">\n           <td>{{friendObj.name}}</td>\n           <td>{{friendObj.phone}}</td>\n         </tr>\n       </table>\n     </file>\n     <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n       var expectFriendNames = function(expectedNames, key) {\n         element.all(by.repeater(key + ' in friends').column(key + '.name')).then(function(arr) {\n           arr.forEach(function(wd, i) {\n             expect(wd.getText()).toMatch(expectedNames[i]);\n           });\n         });\n       };\n\n       it('should search across all fields when filtering with a string', function() {\n         var searchText = element(by.model('searchText'));\n         searchText.clear();\n         searchText.sendKeys('m');\n         expectFriendNames(['Mary', 'Mike', 'Adam'], 'friend');\n\n         searchText.clear();\n         searchText.sendKeys('76');\n         expectFriendNames(['John', 'Julie'], 'friend');\n       });\n\n       it('should search in specific fields when filtering with a predicate object', function() {\n         var searchAny = element(by.model('search.$'));\n         searchAny.clear();\n         searchAny.sendKeys('i');\n         expectFriendNames(['Mary', 'Mike', 'Julie', 'Juliette'], 'friendObj');\n       });\n       it('should use a equal comparison when comparator is true', function() {\n         var searchName = element(by.model('search.name'));\n         var strict = element(by.model('strict'));\n         searchName.clear();\n         searchName.sendKeys('Julie');\n         strict.click();\n         expectFriendNames(['Julie'], 'friendObj');\n       });\n     </file>\n   </example>\n */\n\nfunction filterFilter() {\n  return function(array, expression, comparator, anyPropertyKey) {\n    if (!isArrayLike(array)) {\n      if (array == null) {\n        return array;\n      } else {\n        throw minErr('filter')('notarray', 'Expected array but received: {0}', array);\n      }\n    }\n\n    anyPropertyKey = anyPropertyKey || '$';\n    var expressionType = getTypeForFilter(expression);\n    var predicateFn;\n    var matchAgainstAnyProp;\n\n    switch (expressionType) {\n      case 'function':\n        predicateFn = expression;\n        break;\n      case 'boolean':\n      case 'null':\n      case 'number':\n      case 'string':\n        matchAgainstAnyProp = true;\n        // falls through\n      case 'object':\n        predicateFn = createPredicateFn(expression, comparator, anyPropertyKey, matchAgainstAnyProp);\n        break;\n      default:\n        return array;\n    }\n\n    return Array.prototype.filter.call(array, predicateFn);\n  };\n}\n\n// Helper functions for `filterFilter`\nfunction createPredicateFn(expression, comparator, anyPropertyKey, matchAgainstAnyProp) {\n  var shouldMatchPrimitives = isObject(expression) && (anyPropertyKey in expression);\n  var predicateFn;\n\n  if (comparator === true) {\n    comparator = equals;\n  } else if (!isFunction(comparator)) {\n    comparator = function(actual, expected) {\n      if (isUndefined(actual)) {\n        // No substring matching against `undefined`\n        return false;\n      }\n      if ((actual === null) || (expected === null)) {\n        // No substring matching against `null`;

The `expression` is evaluated against each item and the output is used\n * for comparing with other items.\n *\n * You can change the sorting order by setting `reverse` to `true`. By default, items are sorted in\n * ascending order.\n *\n * The comparison is done using the `comparator` function. If none is specified, a default, built-in\n * comparator is used (see below for details - in a nutshell, it compares numbers numerically and\n * strings alphabetically).\n *\n * ### Under the hood\n *\n * Ordering the specified `collection` happens in two phases:\n *\n * 1. All items are passed through the predicate (or predicates), and the returned values are saved\n *    along with their type (`string`, `number` etc). For example, an item `{label: 'foo'}`, passed\n *    through a predicate that extracts the value of the `label` property, would be transformed to:\n *    ```\n *    {\n *      value: 'foo',\n *      type: 'string',\n *      index: ...\n *    }\n *    ```\n * 2. The comparator function is used to sort the items, based on the derived values, types and\n *    indices.\n *\n * If you use a custom comparator, it will be called with pairs of objects of the form\n * `{value: ..., type: '...', index: ...}` and is expected to return `0` if the objects are equal\n * (as far as the comparator is concerned), `-1` if the 1st one should be ranked higher than the\n * second, or `1` otherwise.\n *\n * In order to ensure that the sorting will be deterministic across platforms, if none of the\n * specified predicates can distinguish between two items, `orderBy` will automatically introduce a\n * dummy predicate that returns the item's index as `value`.\n * (If you are using a custom comparator, make sure it can handle this predicate as well.)\n *\n * If a custom comparator still can't distinguish between two items, then they will be sorted based\n * on their index using the built-in comparator.\n *\n * Finally, in an attempt to simplify things, if a predicate returns an object as the extracted\n * value for an item, `orderBy` will try to convert that object to a primitive value, before passing\n * it to the comparator. The following rules govern the conversion:\n *\n * 1. If the object has a `valueOf()` method that returns a primitive, its return value will be\n *    used instead.<br />\n *    (If the object has a `valueOf()` method that returns another object, then the returned object\n *    will be used in subsequent steps.)\n * 2. If the object has a custom `toString()` method (i.e. not the one inherited from `Object`) that\n *    returns a primitive, its return value will be used instead.<br />\n *    (If the object has a `toString()` method that returns another object, then the returned object\n *    will be used in subsequent steps.)\n * 3. No conversion; the object itself is used.\n *\n * ### The default comparator\n *\n * The default, built-in comparator should be sufficient for most usecases. In short, it compares\n * numbers numerically, strings alphabetically (and case-insensitively), for objects falls back to\n * using their index in the original collection, and sorts values of different types by type.\n *\n * More specifically, it follows these steps to determine the relative order of items:\n *\n * 1. If the compared values are of different types, compare the types themselves alphabetically.\n * 2. If both values are of type `string`, compare them alphabetically in a case- and\n *    locale-insensitive way.\n * 3. If both values are objects, compare their indices instead.\n * 4. Otherwise, return:\n *    -  `0`, if the values are equal (by strict equality comparison, i.e. using `===`).\n *    - `-1`, if the 1st value is \"less than\" the 2nd value (compared using the `<` operator).\n *    -  `1`, otherwise.\n *\n * **Note:** If you notice numbers not being sorted as expected, make sure they are actually being\n *           saved as numbers and not strings.\n * **Note:** For the purpose of sorting, `null` values are treated as the string `'null'` (i.e.\n *           `type: 'string'`, `value: 'null'`). This may cause unexpected sort order relative to\n *           other values.\n *\n * @param {Array|ArrayLike} collection - The collection (array or array-like object) to sort.\n * @param {(Function|string|Array.<Function|string>)=} expression - A predicate (or list of\n *    predicates) to be used by the comparator to determine the order of elements.\n *\n *    Can be one of:\n *\n *    - `Function`: A getter function. This function will be called with each item as argument and\n *      the return value will be used for sorting.\n *    - `string`: An Angular expression. This expression will be evaluated against each item and the\n *      result will be used for sorting. For example, use `'label'` to sort by a property called\n *      `label` or `'label.substring(0, 3)'` to sort by the first 3 characters of the `label`\n *      property.<br />\n *      (The result of a constant expression is interpreted as a property name to be used for\n *      comparison. For example, use `'\"special name\"'` (note the extra pair of quotes) to sort by a\n *      property called `special name`.)<br />\n *      An expression can be optionally prefixed with `+` or `-` to control the sorting direction,\n *      ascending or descending. For example, `'+label'` or `'-label'`. If no property is provided,\n *      (e.g. `'+'` or `'-'`), the collection element itself is used in comparisons.\n *    - `Array`: An array of function and/or string predicates. If a predicate cannot determine the\n *      relative order of two items, the next predicate is used as a tie-breaker.\n *\n * **Note:** If the predicate is missing or empty then it defaults to `'+'`.\n *\n * @param {boolean=} reverse - If `true`, reverse the sorting order.\n * @param {(Function)=} comparator - The comparator function used to determine the relative order of\n *    value pairs. If omitted, the built-in comparator will be used.\n *\n * @returns {Array} - The sorted array.\n *\n *\n * @example\n * ### Ordering a table with `ngRepeat`\n *\n * The example below demonstrates a simple {@link ngRepeat ngRepeat}, where the data is sorted by\n * age in descending order (expression is set to `'-age'`). The `comparator` is not set, which means\n * it defaults to the built-in comparator.\n *\n   <example name=\"orderBy-static\" module=\"orderByExample1\">\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n         <table class=\"friends\">\n           <tr>\n             <th>Name</th>\n             <th>Phone Number</th>\n             <th>Age</th>\n           </tr>\n           <tr ng-repeat=\"friend in friends | orderBy:'-age'\">\n             <td>{{friend.name}}</td>\n             <td>{{friend.phone}}</td>\n             <td>{{friend.age}}</td>\n           </tr>\n         </table>\n       </div>\n     </file>\n     <file name=\"script.js\">\n       angular.module('orderByExample1', [])\n         .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n           $scope.friends = [\n             {name: 'John',   phone: '555-1212',  age: 10},\n             {name: 'Mary',   phone: '555-9876',  age: 19},\n             {name: 'Mike',   phone: '555-4321',  age: 21},\n             {name: 'Adam',   phone: '555-5678',  age: 35},\n             {name: 'Julie',  phone: '555-8765',  age: 29}\n           ];\n         }]);\n     </file>\n     <file name=\"style.css\">\n       .friends {\n         border-collapse: collapse;\n       }\n\n       .friends th {\n         border-bottom: 1px solid;\n       }\n       .friends td, .friends th {\n         border-left: 1px solid;\n         padding: 5px 10px;\n       }\n       .friends td:first-child, .friends th:first-child {\n         border-left: none;\n       }\n     </file>\n     <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n       // Element locators\n       var names = element.all(by.repeater('friends').column('friend.name'));\n\n       it('should sort friends by age in reverse order', function() {\n         expect(names.get(0).getText()).toBe('Adam');\n         expect(names.get(1).getText()).toBe('Julie');\n         expect(names.get(2).getText()).toBe('Mike');\n         expect(names.get(3).getText()).toBe('Mary');\n         expect(names.get(4).getText()).toBe('John');\n       });\n     </file>\n   </example>\n * <hr />\n *\n * @example\n * ### Changing parameters dynamically\n *\n * All parameters can be changed dynamically.

This means that the outer form is valid when all of the child\n * forms are valid as well. However, browsers do not allow nesting of `<form>` elements, so\n * Angular provides the {@link ng.directive:ngForm `ngForm`} directive, which behaves identically to\n * `form` but can be nested. Nested forms can be useful, for example, if the validity of a sub-group\n * of controls needs to be determined.\n *\n * ## CSS classes\n *  - `ng-valid` is set if the form is valid.\n *  - `ng-invalid` is set if the form is invalid.\n *  - `ng-pending` is set if the form is pending.\n *  - `ng-pristine` is set if the form is pristine.\n *  - `ng-dirty` is set if the form is dirty.\n *  - `ng-submitted` is set if the form was submitted.\n *\n * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.\n *\n *\n * ## Submitting a form and preventing the default action\n *\n * Since the role of forms in client-side Angular applications is different than in classical\n * roundtrip apps, it is desirable for the browser not to translate the form submission into a full\n * page reload that sends the data to the server. Instead some javascript logic should be triggered\n * to handle the form submission in an application-specific way.\n *\n * For this reason, Angular prevents the default action (form submission to the server) unless the\n * `<form>` element has an `action` attribute specified.\n *\n * You can use one of the following two ways to specify what javascript method should be called when\n * a form is submitted:\n *\n * - {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit} directive on the form element\n * - {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directive on the first\n  *  button or input field of type submit (input[type=submit])\n *\n * To prevent double execution of the handler, use only one of the {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit}\n * or {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directives.\n * This is because of the following form submission rules in the HTML specification:\n *\n * - If a form has only one input field then hitting enter in this field triggers form submit\n * (`ngSubmit`)\n * - if a form has 2+ input fields and no buttons or input[type=submit] then hitting enter\n * doesn't trigger submit\n * - if a form has one or more input fields and one or more buttons or input[type=submit] then\n * hitting enter in any of the input fields will trigger the click handler on the *first* button or\n * input[type=submit] (`ngClick`) *and* a submit handler on the enclosing form (`ngSubmit`)\n *\n * Any pending `ngModelOptions` changes will take place immediately when an enclosing form is\n * submitted. Note that `ngClick` events will occur before the model is updated. Use `ngSubmit`\n * to have access to the updated model.\n *\n * @animations\n * Animations in ngForm are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed.\n * These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`, `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any\n * other validations that are performed within the form. Animations in ngForm are similar to how\n * they work in ngClass and animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well\n * as JS animations.\n *\n * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style a form element\n * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:\n *\n * <pre>\n * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more\n * //advanced animations\n * .my-form {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   background: white;\n * }\n * .my-form.ng-invalid {\n *   background: red;\n *   color:white;\n * }\n * </pre>\n *\n * @example\n    <example name=\"ng-form\" deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\" fixBase=\"true\" module=\"formExample\">\n      <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <script>\n         angular.module('formExample', [])\n           .controller('FormController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n             $scope.userType = 'guest';\n           }]);\n       </script>\n       <style>\n        .my-form {\n          transition:all linear 0.5s;\n          background: transparent;\n        }\n        .my-form.ng-invalid {\n          background: red;\n        }\n       </style>\n       <form name=\"myForm\" ng-controller=\"FormController\" class=\"my-form\">\n         userType: <input name=\"input\" ng-model=\"userType\" required>\n         <span class=\"error\" ng-show=\"myForm.input.$error.required\">Required!</span><br>\n         <code>userType = {{userType}}</code><br>\n         <code>myForm.input.$valid = {{myForm.input.$valid}}</code><br>\n         <code>myForm.input.$error = {{myForm.input.$error}}</code><br>\n         <code>myForm.$valid = {{myForm.$valid}}</code><br>\n         <code>myForm.$error.required = {{!!myForm.$error.required}}</code><br>\n        </form>\n      </file>\n      <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n        it('should initialize to model', function() {\n          var userType = element(by.binding('userType'));\n          var valid = element(by.binding('myForm.input.$valid'));\n\n          expect(userType.getText()).toContain('guest');\n          expect(valid.getText()).toContain('true');\n        });\n\n        it('should be invalid if empty', function() {\n          var userType = element(by.binding('userType'));\n          var valid = element(by.binding('myForm.input.$valid'));\n          var userInput = element(by.model('userType'));\n\n          userInput.clear();\n          userInput.sendKeys('');\n\n          expect(userType.getText()).toEqual('userType =');\n          expect(valid.getText()).toContain('false');\n        });\n      </file>\n    </example>\n *\n * @param {string=} name Name of the form.

Model binding,\n   * validation and number parsing are nevertheless supported.\n   *\n   * Browsers that support range (latest Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) treat `input[range]`\n   * in a way that never allows the input to hold an invalid value. That means:\n   * - any non-numerical value is set to `(max + min) / 2`.\n   * - any numerical value that is less than the current min val, or greater than the current max val\n   * is set to the min / max val respectively.\n   * - additionally, the current `step` is respected, so the nearest value that satisfies a step\n   * is used.\n   *\n   * See the [HTML Spec on input[type=range]](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#range-state-(type=range))\n   * for more info.\n   *\n   * This has the following consequences for Angular:\n   *\n   * Since the element value should always reflect the current model value, a range input\n   * will set the bound ngModel expression to the value that the browser has set for the\n   * input element. For example, in the following input `<input type=\"range\" ng-model=\"model.value\">`,\n   * if the application sets `model.value = null`, the browser will set the input to `'50'`.\n   * Angular will then set the model to `50`, to prevent input and model value being out of sync.\n   *\n   * That means the model for range will immediately be set to `50` after `ngModel` has been\n   * initialized. It also means a range input can never have the required error.\n   *\n   * This does not only affect changes to the model value, but also to the values of the `min`,\n   * `max`, and `step` attributes. When these change in a way that will cause the browser to modify\n   * the input value, Angular will also update the model value.\n   *\n   * Automatic value adjustment also means that a range input element can never have the `required`,\n   * `min`, or `max` errors.\n   *\n   * However, `step` is currently only fully implemented by Firefox. Other browsers have problems\n   * when the step value changes dynamically - they do not adjust the element value correctly, but\n   * instead may set the `stepMismatch` error. If that's the case, the Angular will set the `step`\n   * error on the input, and set the model to `undefined`.\n   *\n   * Note that `input[range]` is not compatible with`ngMax`, `ngMin`, and `ngStep`, because they do\n   * not set the `min` and `max` attributes, which means that the browser won't automatically adjust\n   * the input value based on their values, and will always assume min = 0, max = 100, and step = 1.\n   *\n   * @param {string}  ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.\n   * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.\n   * @param {string=} min Sets the `min` validation to ensure that the value entered is greater\n   *                  than `min`.

If the expression evaluates to a string, the string should be one or more space-delimited class\n * names.\n *\n * 2. If the expression evaluates to an object, then for each key-value pair of the\n * object with a truthy value the corresponding key is used as a class name.\n *\n * 3. If the expression evaluates to an array, each element of the array should either be a string as in\n * type 1 or an object as in type 2. This means that you can mix strings and objects together in an array\n * to give you more control over what CSS classes appear. See the code below for an example of this.\n *\n *\n * The directive won't add duplicate classes if a particular class was already set.\n *\n * When the expression changes, the previously added classes are removed and only then are the\n * new classes added.\n *\n * @knownIssue\n * You should not use {@link guide/interpolation interpolation} in the value of the `class`\n * attribute, when using the `ngClass` directive on the same element.\n * See {@link guide/interpolation#known-issues here} for more info.\n *\n * @animations\n * | Animation                        | Occurs                              |\n * |----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n * | {@link ng.$animate#addClass addClass}       | just before the class is applied to the element   |\n * | {@link ng.$animate#removeClass removeClass} | just before the class is removed from the element |\n *\n * ### ngClass and pre-existing CSS3 Transitions/Animations\n   The ngClass directive still supports CSS3 Transitions/Animations even if they do not follow the ngAnimate CSS naming structure.\n   Upon animation ngAnimate will apply supplementary CSS classes to track the start and end of an animation, but this will not hinder\n   any pre-existing CSS transitions already on the element. To get an idea of what happens during a class-based animation, be sure\n   to view the step by step details of {@link $animate#addClass $animate.addClass} and\n   {@link $animate#removeClass $animate.removeClass}.\n *\n * @param {expression} ngClass {@link guide/expression Expression} to eval. The result\n *   of the evaluation can be a string representing space delimited class\n *   names, an array, or a map of class names to boolean values. In the case of a map, the\n *   names of the properties whose values are truthy will be added as css classes to the\n *   element.\n *\n * @example\n * ### Basic\n   <example name=\"ng-class\">\n

This is a key aspect of how angular\n * supports the principles behind the Model-View-Controller design pattern.\n *\n * MVC components in angular:\n *\n * * Model — Models are the properties of a scope; scopes are attached to the DOM where scope properties\n *   are accessed through bindings.\n * * View — The template (HTML with data bindings) that is rendered into the View.\n * * Controller — The `ngController` directive specifies a Controller class; the class contains business\n *   logic behind the application to decorate the scope with functions and values\n *\n * Note that you can also attach controllers to the DOM by declaring it in a route definition\n * via the {@link ngRoute.$route $route} service. A common mistake is to declare the controller\n * again using `ng-controller` in the template itself.  This will cause the controller to be attached\n * and executed twice.\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @scope\n * @priority 500\n * @param {expression} ngController Name of a constructor function registered with the current\n * {@link ng.$controllerProvider $controllerProvider} or an {@link guide/expression expression}\n * that on the current scope evaluates to a constructor function.\n *\n * The controller instance can be published into a scope property by specifying\n * `ng-controller=\"as propertyName\"`.\n *\n * If the current `$controllerProvider` is configured to use globals (via\n * {@link ng.$controllerProvider#allowGlobals `$controllerProvider.allowGlobals()` }), this may\n * also be the name of a globally accessible constructor function (deprecated, not recommended).\n *\n * @example\n * Here is a simple form for editing user contact information. Adding, removing, clearing, and\n * greeting are methods declared on the controller (see source tab). These methods can\n * easily be called from the angular markup. Any changes to the data are automatically reflected\n * in the View without the need for a manual update.\n *\n * Two different declaration styles are included below:\n *\n * * one binds methods and properties directly onto the controller using `this`:\n * `ng-controller=\"SettingsController1 as settings\"`\n * * one injects `$scope` into the controller:\n * `ng-controller=\"SettingsController2\"`\n *\n * The second option is more common in the Angular community, and is generally used in boilerplates\n * and in this guide. However, there are advantages to binding properties directly to the controller\n * and avoiding scope.\n *\n * * Using `controller as` makes it obvious which controller you are accessing in the template when\n * multiple controllers apply to an element.\n * * If you are writing your controllers as classes you have easier access to the properties and\n * methods, which will appear on the scope, from inside the controller code.\n * * Since there is always a `.` in the bindings, you don't have to worry about prototypal\n * inheritance masking primitives.\n *\n * This example demonstrates the `controller as` syntax.\n *\n * <example name=\"ngControllerAs\" module=\"controllerAsExample\">\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *    <div id=\"ctrl-as-exmpl\"

@ngdoc directive\n * @name ngCsp\n *\n * @restrict A\n * @element ANY\n * @description\n *\n * Angular has some features that can conflict with certain restrictions that are applied when using\n * [CSP (Content Security Policy)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP) rules.\n *\n * If you intend to implement CSP with these rules then you must tell Angular not to use these\n * features.\n *\n * This is necessary when developing things like Google Chrome Extensions or Universal Windows Apps.\n *\n *\n * The following default rules in CSP affect Angular:\n *\n * * The use of `eval()`, `Function(string)` and similar functions to dynamically create and execute\n * code from strings is forbidden. Angular makes use of this in the {@link $parse} service to\n * provide a 30% increase in the speed of evaluating Angular expressions. (This CSP rule can be\n * disabled with the CSP keyword `unsafe-eval`, but it is generally not recommended as it would\n * weaken the protections offered by CSP.)\n *\n * * The use of inline resources, such as inline `<script>` and `<style>` elements, are forbidden.\n * This prevents apps from injecting custom styles directly into the document. Angular makes use of\n * this to include some CSS rules (e.g. {@link ngCloak} and {@link ngHide}). To make these\n * directives work when a CSP rule is blocking inline styles, you must link to the `angular-csp.css`\n * in your HTML manually. (This CSP rule can be disabled with the CSP keyword `unsafe-inline`, but\n * it is generally not recommended as it would weaken the protections offered by CSP.)\n *\n * If you do not provide `ngCsp` then Angular tries to autodetect if CSP is blocking dynamic code\n * creation from strings (e.g., `unsafe-eval` not specified in CSP header) and automatically\n * deactivates this feature in the {@link $parse} service. This autodetection, however, triggers a\n * CSP error to be logged in the console:\n *\n * ```\n * Refused to evaluate a string as JavaScript because 'unsafe-eval' is not an allowed source of\n * script in the following Content Security Policy directive: \"default-src 'self'\". Note that\n * 'script-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.\n * ```\n *\n * This error is harmless but annoying. To prevent the error from showing up, put the `ngCsp`\n * directive on an element of the HTML document that appears before the `<script>` tag that loads\n * the `angular.js` file.\n *\n * *Note: This directive is only available in the `ng-csp` and `data-ng-csp` attribute form.*\n *\n * You can specify which of the CSP related Angular features should be deactivated by providing\n * a value for the `ng-csp` attribute. The options are as follows:\n *\n * * no-inline-style: this stops Angular from injecting CSS styles into the DOM\n *\n * * no-unsafe-eval: this stops Angular from optimizing $parse with unsafe eval of strings\n *\n * You can use these values in the following combinations:\n *\n *\n * * No declaration means that Angular will assume that you can do inline styles, but it will do\n * a runtime check for unsafe-eval. E.g. `<body>`. This is backwardly compatible with previous\n * versions of Angular.\n *\n * * A simple `ng-csp` (or `data-ng-csp`) attribute will tell Angular to deactivate both inline\n * styles and unsafe eval. E.g. `<body ng-csp>`. This is backwardly compatible with previous\n * versions of Angular.\n *\n * * Specifying only `no-unsafe-eval` tells Angular that we must not use eval, but that we can\n * inject inline styles.

If the expression assigned to `ngIf` evaluates to a false\n * value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the\n * element is reinserted into the DOM.\n *\n * `ngIf` differs from `ngShow` and `ngHide` in that `ngIf` completely removes and recreates the\n * element in the DOM rather than changing its visibility via the `display` css property.  A common\n * case when this difference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an element's\n * position within the DOM, such as the `:first-child` or `:last-child` pseudo-classes.\n *\n * Note that when an element is removed using `ngIf` its scope is destroyed and a new scope\n * is created when the element is restored.  The scope created within `ngIf` inherits from\n * its parent scope using\n * [prototypal inheritance](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes#javascript-prototypal-inheritance).\n * An important implication of this is if `ngModel` is used within `ngIf` to bind to\n * a javascript primitive defined in the parent scope. In this case any modifications made to the\n * variable within the child scope will override (hide) the value in the parent scope.\n *\n * Also, `ngIf` recreates elements using their compiled state. An example of this behavior\n * is if an element's class attribute is directly modified after it's compiled, using something like\n * jQuery's `.addClass()` method, and the element is later removed. When `ngIf` recreates the element\n * the added class will be lost because the original compiled state is used to regenerate the element.\n *\n * Additionally, you can provide animations via the `ngAnimate` module to animate the `enter`\n * and `leave` effects.\n *\n * @animations\n * | Animation                        | Occurs                               |\n * |----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n * | {@link ng.$animate#enter enter}  | just after the `ngIf` contents change and a new DOM element is created and injected into the `ngIf` container |\n * | {@link ng.$animate#leave leave}  | just before the `ngIf` contents are removed from the DOM |\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @scope\n * @priority 600\n * @param {expression} ngIf If the {@link guide/expression expression} is falsy then\n *     the element is removed from the DOM tree.

This implies that the user of the directive is responsible for\n *   dealing with whitespace but also allows you to use whitespace as a delimiter, such as a\n *   tab or newline character.\n * * Otherwise whitespace around the delimiter is ignored when splitting (although it is respected\n *   when joining the list items back together) and whitespace around each list item is stripped\n *   before it is added to the model.\n *\n * @example\n * ### Validation\n *\n * <example name=\"ngList-directive\" module=\"listExample\">\n *   <file name=\"app.js\">\n *      angular.module('listExample', [])\n *        .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n *          $scope.names = ['morpheus', 'neo', 'trinity'];\n *        }]);\n *   </file>\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *    <form name=\"myForm\" ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n *      <label>List: <input name=\"namesInput\" ng-model=\"names\" ng-list required></label>\n *      <span role=\"alert\">\n *        <span class=\"error\" ng-show=\"myForm.namesInput.$error.required\">\n *        Required!</span>\n *      </span>\n *      <br>\n *      <tt>names = {{names}}</tt><br/>\n *      <tt>myForm.namesInput.$valid = {{myForm.namesInput.$valid}}</tt><br/>\n *      <tt>myForm.namesInput.$error = {{myForm.namesInput.$error}}</tt><br/>\n *      <tt>myForm.$valid = {{myForm.$valid}}</tt><br/>\n *      <tt>myForm.$error.required = {{!!myForm.$error.required}}</tt><br/>\n *     </form>\n *   </file>\n *   <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n *     var listInput = element(by.model('names'));\n *     var names = element(by.exactBinding('names'));\n *     var valid = element(by.binding('myForm.namesInput.$valid'));\n *     var error = element(by.css('span.error'));\n *\n *     it('should initialize to model', function() {\n *       expect(names.getText()).toContain('[\"morpheus\",\"neo\",\"trinity\"]');\n *       expect(valid.getText()).toContain('true');\n *       expect(error.getCssValue('display')).toBe('none');\n *     });\n *\n *     it('should be invalid if empty', function() {\n *       listInput.clear();\n *       listInput.sendKeys('');\n *\n *       expect(names.getText()).toContain('');\n *       expect(valid.getText()).toContain('false');\n *       expect(error.getCssValue('display')).not.toBe('none');\n *     });\n *   </file>\n * </example>\n *\n * @example\n * ### Splitting on newline\n *\n * <example name=\"ngList-directive-newlines\">\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *    <textarea ng-model=\"list\" ng-list=\"&#10;\" ng-trim=\"false\"></textarea>\n *    <pre>{{ list | json }}</pre>\n *   </file>\n *   <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n *     it(\"should split the text by newlines\", function() {\n *       var listInput = element(by.model('list'));\n *       var output = element(by.binding('list | json'));\n *       listInput.sendKeys('abc\\ndef\\nghi');\n *       expect(output.getText()).toContain('[\\n  \"abc\",\\n  \"def\",\\n  \"ghi\"\\n]');\n *     });\n *   </file>\n * </example>\n *\n */\nvar ngListDirective = function() {\n  return {\n    restrict: 'A',\n    priority: 100,\n    require: 'ngModel',\n    link: function(scope, element, attr, ctrl) {\n      var ngList = attr.ngList || ', ';\n      var trimValues = attr.ngTrim !== 'false';\n      var separator = trimValues ? trim(ngList) : ngList;\n\n      var parse = function(viewValue) {\n        // If the viewValue is invalid (say required but empty) it will be `undefined`\n        if (isUndefined(viewValue)) return;\n\n        var list = [];\n\n        if (viewValue) {\n          forEach(viewValue.split(separator), function(value) {\n            if (value) list.push(trimValues ? trim(value) : value);\n          });\n        }\n\n        return list;\n      };\n\n      ctrl.$parsers.push(parse);\n      ctrl.$formatters.push(function(value) {\n        if (isArray(value)) {\n          return value.join(ngList);\n        }\n\n        return undefined;\n      });\n\n      // Override the standard $isEmpty because an empty array means the input is empty.\n      ctrl.$isEmpty = function(value) {\n        return !value || !value.length;\n      };\n    }\n  };\n};\n\n/* global VALID_CLASS: true,\n  INVALID_CLASS: true,\n  PRISTINE_CLASS: true,\n  DIRTY_CLASS: true,\n  UNTOUCHED_CLASS: true,\n  TOUCHED_CLASS: true,\n  PENDING_CLASS: true,\n  addSetValidityMethod: true,\n  setupValidity: true,\n  defaultModelOptions: false\n*/\n\n\nvar VALID_CLASS = 'ng-valid',\n    INVALID_CLASS = 'ng-invalid',\n    PRISTINE_CLASS = 'ng-pristine',\n    DIRTY_CLASS = 'ng-dirty',\n    UNTOUCHED_CLASS = 'ng-untouched',\n    TOUCHED_CLASS = 'ng-touched',\n    EMPTY_CLASS = 'ng-empty',\n    NOT_EMPTY_CLASS = 'ng-not-empty';\n\nvar ngModelMinErr = minErr('ngModel');\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc type\n * @name ngModel.NgModelController\n * @property {*} $viewValue The actual value from the control's view.

The last return value is forwarded to the\n    {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$validators `$validators`} collection.\n\n  Parsers are used to sanitize / convert the {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$viewValue\n    `$viewValue`}.\n\n  Returning `undefined` from a parser means a parse error occurred. In that case,\n    no {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$validators `$validators`} will run and the `ngModel`\n    will be set to `undefined` unless {@link ngModelOptions `ngModelOptions.allowInvalid`}\n    is set to `true`. The parse error is stored in `ngModel.$error.parse`.\n\n  This simple example shows a parser that would convert text input value to lowercase:\n * ```js\n * function parse(value) {\n *   if (value) {\n *     return value.toLowerCase();\n *   }\n * }\n * ngModelController.$parsers.push(parse);\n * ```\n\n *\n * @property {Array.<Function>} $formatters Array of functions to execute, as a pipeline, whenever\n    the bound ngModel expression changes programmatically. The `$formatters` are not called when the\n    value of the control is changed by user interaction.\n\n  Formatters are used to format / convert the {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$modelValue\n    `$modelValue`} for display in the control.\n\n  The functions are called in reverse array order, each passing the value through to the\n    next. The last return value is used as the actual DOM value.\n\n  This simple example shows a formatter that would convert the model value to uppercase:\n\n * ```js\n * function format(value) {\n *   if (value) {\n *     return value.toUpperCase();\n *   }\n * }\n * ngModel.$formatters.push(format);\n * ```\n *\n * @property {Object.<string, function>} $validators A collection of validators that are applied\n *      whenever the model value changes. The key value within the object refers to the name of the\n *      validator while the function refers to the validation operation. The validation operation is\n *      provided with the model value as an argument and must return a true or false value depending\n *      on the response of that validation.\n *\n * ```js\n * ngModel.$validators.validCharacters = function(modelValue, viewValue) {\n *   var value = modelValue || viewValue;\n *   return /[0-9]+/.test(value) &&\n *          /[a-z]+/.test(value) &&\n *          /[A-Z]+/.test(value) &&\n *          /\\W+/.test(value);\n * };\n * ```\n *\n * @property {Object.<string, function>} $asyncValidators A collection of validations that are expected to\n *      perform an asynchronous validation (e.g. a HTTP request). The validation function that is provided\n *      is expected to return a promise when it is run during the model validation process. Once the promise\n *      is delivered then the validation status will be set to true when fulfilled and false when rejected.\n *      When the asynchronous validators are triggered, each of the validators will run in parallel and the model\n *      value will only be updated once all validators have been fulfilled. As long as an asynchronous validator\n *      is unfulfilled, its key will be added to the controllers `$pending` property. Also, all asynchronous validators\n *      will only run once all synchronous validators have passed.\n *\n * Please note that if $http is used then it is important that the server returns a success HTTP response code\n * in order to fulfill the validation and a status level of `4xx` in order to reject the validation.\n *\n * ```js\n * ngModel.$asyncValidators.uniqueUsername = function(modelValue, viewValue) {\n *   var value = modelValue || viewValue;\n *\n *   // Lookup user by username\n *   return $http.get('/api/users/' + value).\n *      then(function resolved() {\n *        //username exists, this means validation fails\n *        return $q.reject('exists');\n *      }, function rejected() {\n *        //username does not exist, therefore this validation passes\n *        return true;\n *      });\n * };\n * ```\n *\n * @property {Array.<Function>} $viewChangeListeners Array of functions to execute whenever the\n *     view value has changed. It is called with no arguments, and its return value is ignored.\n *     This can be used in place of additional $watches against the model value.\n *\n * @property {Object} $error An object hash with all failing validator ids as keys.\n * @property {Object} $pending An object hash with all pending validator ids as keys.\n *\n * @property {boolean} $untouched True if control has not lost focus yet.\n * @property {boolean} $touched True if control has lost focus.\n * @property {boolean} $pristine True if user has not interacted with the control yet.\n * @property {boolean} $dirty True if user has already interacted with the control.\n * @property {boolean} $valid True if there is no error.\n * @property {boolean} $invalid True if at least one error on the control.\n * @property {string} $name The name attribute of the control.\n *\n * @description\n *\n * `NgModelController` provides API for the {@link ngModel `ngModel`} directive.\n * The controller contains services for data-binding, validation, CSS updates, and value formatting\n * and parsing. It purposefully does not contain any logic which deals with DOM rendering or\n * listening to DOM events.\n * Such DOM related logic should be provided by other directives which make use of\n * `NgModelController` for data-binding to control elements.\n * Angular provides this DOM logic for most {@link input `input`} elements.\n * At the end of this page you can find a {@link ngModel.NgModelController#custom-control-example\n * custom control example} that uses `ngModelController` to bind to `contenteditable` elements.\n *\n * @example\n * ### Custom Control Example\n * This example shows how to use `NgModelController` with a custom control to achieve\n * data-binding. Notice how different directives (`contenteditable`, `ng-model`, and `required`)\n * collaborate together to achieve the desired result.\n *\n * `contenteditable` is an HTML5 attribute, which tells the browser to let the element\n * contents be edited in place by the user.\n *\n * We are using the {@link ng.service:$sce $sce} service here and include the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize}\n * module to automatically remove \"bad\" content like inline event listener (e.g. `<span onclick=\"...\">`).\n * However, as we are using `$sce` the model can still decide to provide unsafe content if it marks\n * that content using the `$sce` service.\n *\n * <example name=\"NgModelController\" module=\"customControl\" deps=\"angular-sanitize.js\">\n    <file name=\"style.css\">\n      [contenteditable] {\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        background-color: white;\n        min-height: 20px;\n      }\n\n      .ng-invalid {\n        border: 1px solid red;\n      }\n\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"script.js\">\n      angular.module('customControl', ['ngSanitize']).\n        directive('contenteditable', ['$sce', function($sce) {\n          return {\n            restrict: 'A', // only activate on element attribute\n            require: '?ngModel', // get a hold of NgModelController\n            link: function(scope, element, attrs, ngModel) {\n              if (!ngModel) return;

If the property doesn't already exist on this scope, it will be created\n * implicitly and added to the scope.\n *\n * For best practices on using `ngModel`, see:\n *\n *  - [Understanding Scopes](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes)\n *\n * For basic examples, how to use `ngModel`, see:\n *\n *  - {@link ng.directive:input input}\n *    - {@link input[text] text}\n *    - {@link input[checkbox] checkbox}\n *    - {@link input[radio] radio}\n *    - {@link input[number] number}\n *    - {@link input[email] email}\n *    - {@link input[url] url}\n *    - {@link input[date] date}\n *    - {@link input[datetime-local] datetime-local}\n *    - {@link input[time] time}\n *    - {@link input[month] month}\n *    - {@link input[week] week}\n *  - {@link ng.directive:select select}\n *  - {@link ng.directive:textarea textarea}\n *\n * ## Complex Models (objects or collections)\n *\n * By default, `ngModel` watches the model by reference, not value. This is important to know when\n * binding inputs to models that are objects (e.g. `Date`) or collections (e.g. arrays). If only properties of the\n * object or collection change, `ngModel` will not be notified and so the input will not be  re-rendered.\n *\n * The model must be assigned an entirely new object or collection before a re-rendering will occur.\n *\n * Some directives have options that will cause them to use a custom `$watchCollection` on the model expression\n * - for example, `ngOptions` will do so when a `track by` clause is included in the comprehension expression or\n * if the select is given the `multiple` attribute.\n *\n * The `$watchCollection()` method only does a shallow comparison, meaning that changing properties deeper than the\n * first level of the object (or only changing the properties of an item in the collection if it's an array) will still\n * not trigger a re-rendering of the model.\n *\n * ## CSS classes\n * The following CSS classes are added and removed on the associated input/select/textarea element\n * depending on the validity of the model.\n *\n *  - `ng-valid`: the model is valid\n *  - `ng-invalid`: the model is invalid\n *  - `ng-valid-[key]`: for each valid key added by `$setValidity`\n *  - `ng-invalid-[key]`: for each invalid key added by `$setValidity`\n *  - `ng-pristine`: the control hasn't been interacted with yet\n *  - `ng-dirty`: the control has been interacted with\n *  - `ng-touched`: the control has been blurred\n *  - `ng-untouched`: the control hasn't been blurred\n *  - `ng-pending`: any `$asyncValidators` are unfulfilled\n *  - `ng-empty`: the view does not contain a value or the value is deemed \"empty\", as defined\n *     by the {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$isEmpty} method\n *  - `ng-not-empty`: the view contains a non-empty value\n *\n * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.\n *\n * @animations\n * Animations within models are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed\n * on the input element which is attached to the model. These classes include: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`,\n * `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any other validations that are performed on the model itself.\n * The animations that are triggered within ngModel are similar to how they work in ngClass and\n * animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well as JS animations.\n *\n * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style an input element\n * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:\n *\n * <pre>\n * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more\n * //advanced animations\n * .my-input {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   background: white;\n * }\n * .my-input.ng-invalid {\n *   background: red;\n *   color:white;\n * }\n * </pre>\n *\n * @example\n * ### Basic Usage\n * <example deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\" fixBase=\"true\" module=\"inputExample\" name=\"ng-model\">\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <script>\n        angular.module('inputExample', [])\n          .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n            $scope.val = '1';\n          }]);\n       </script>\n       <style>\n         .my-input {\n           transition:all linear 0.5s;\n           background: transparent;\n         }\n         .my-input.ng-invalid {\n           color:white;\n           background: red;\n         }\n       </style>\n       <p id=\"inputDescription\">\n        Update input to see transitions when valid/invalid.\n        Integer is a valid value.\n       </p>\n       <form name=\"testForm\" ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n         <input ng-model=\"val\" ng-pattern=\"/^\\d+$/\" name=\"anim\" class=\"my-input\"\n                aria-describedby=\"inputDescription\" />\n       </form>\n     </file>\n * </example>\n *\n * @example\n * ### Binding to a getter/setter\n *\n * Sometimes it's helpful to bind `ngModel` to a getter/setter function.  A getter/setter is a\n * function that returns a representation of the model when called with zero arguments, and sets\n * the internal state of a model when called with an argument. It's sometimes useful to use this\n * for models that have an internal representation that's different from what the model exposes\n * to the view.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n * **Best Practice:** It's best to keep getters fast because Angular is likely to call them more\n * frequently than other parts of your code.\n * </div>\n *\n * You use this behavior by adding `ng-model-options=\"{ getterSetter: true }\"` to an element that\n * has `ng-model` attached to it. You can also add `ng-model-options=\"{ getterSetter: true }\"` to\n * a `<form>`, which will enable this behavior for all `<input>`s within it. See\n * {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions `ngModelOptions`} for more.\n *\n * The following example shows how to use `ngModel` with a getter/setter:\n *\n * @example\n * <example name=\"ngModel-getter-setter\" module=\"getterSetterExample\">\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n         <form name=\"userForm\">\n           <label>Name:\n             <input type=\"text\" name=\"userName\"\n                    ng-model=\"user.name\"\n                    ng-model-options=\"{ getterSetter: true }\" />\n           </label>\n         </form>\n         <pre>user.name = <span ng-bind=\"user.name()\"></span></pre>\n       </div>\n     </file>\n     <file name=\"app.js\">\n       angular.module('getterSetterExample', [])\n         .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n           var _name = 'Brian';\n           $scope.user = {\n             name: function(newName) {\n              // Note that newName can be undefined for two reasons:\n              // 1.

You can specify an `ngModelOptions` directive on any element. All {@link ngModel}\n * directives will use the options of their nearest `ngModelOptions` ancestor.\n *\n * The `ngModelOptions` settings are found by evaluating the value of the attribute directive as\n * an Angular expression. This expression should evaluate to an object, whose properties contain\n * the settings. For example: `<div \"ng-model-options\"=\"{ debounce: 100 }\"`.\n *\n * ## Inheriting Options\n *\n * You can specify that an `ngModelOptions` setting should be inherited from a parent `ngModelOptions`\n * directive by giving it the value of `\"$inherit\"`.\n * Then it will inherit that setting from the first `ngModelOptions` directive found by traversing up the\n * DOM tree. If there is no ancestor element containing an `ngModelOptions` directive then default settings\n * will be used.\n *\n * For example given the following fragment of HTML\n *\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-model-options=\"{ allowInvalid: true, debounce: 200 }\">\n *   <form ng-model-options=\"{ updateOn: 'blur', allowInvalid: '$inherit' }\">\n *     <input ng-model-options=\"{ updateOn: 'default', allowInvalid: '$inherit' }\" />\n *   </form>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * the `input` element will have the following settings\n *\n * ```js\n * { allowInvalid: true, updateOn: 'default', debounce: 0 }\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that the `debounce` setting was not inherited and used the default value instead.\n *\n * You can specify that all undefined settings are automatically inherited from an ancestor by\n * including a property with key of `\"*\"` and value of `\"$inherit\"`.\n *\n * For example given the following fragment of HTML\n *\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-model-options=\"{ allowInvalid: true, debounce: 200 }\">\n *   <form ng-model-options=\"{ updateOn: 'blur', \"*\": '$inherit' }\">\n *     <input ng-model-options=\"{ updateOn: 'default', \"*\": '$inherit' }\" />\n *   </form>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * the `input` element will have the following settings\n *\n * ```js\n * { allowInvalid: true, updateOn: 'default', debounce: 200 }\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that the `debounce` setting now inherits the value from the outer `<div>` element.\n *\n * If you are creating a reusable component then you should be careful when using `\"*\": \"$inherit\"`\n * since you may inadvertently inherit a setting in the future that changes the behavior of your component.\n *\n *\n * ## Triggering and debouncing model updates\n *\n * The `updateOn` and `debounce` properties allow you to specify a custom list of events that will\n * trigger a model update and/or a debouncing delay so that the actual update only takes place when\n * a timer expires; this timer will be reset after another change takes place.\n *\n * Given the nature of `ngModelOptions`, the value displayed inside input fields in the view might\n * be different from the value in the actual model. This means that if you update the model you\n * should also invoke {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$rollbackViewValue} on the relevant input field in\n * order to make sure it is synchronized with the model and that any debounced action is canceled.\n *\n * The easiest way to reference the control's {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$rollbackViewValue}\n * method is by making sure the input is placed inside a form that has a `name` attribute. This is\n * important because `form` controllers are published to the related scope under the name in their\n * `name` attribute.\n *\n * Any pending changes will take place immediately when an enclosing form is submitted via the\n * `submit` event. Note that `ngClick` events will occur before the model is updated. Use `ngSubmit`\n * to have access to the updated model.\n *\n * The following example shows how to override immediate updates. Changes on the inputs within the\n * form will update the model only when the control loses focus (blur event). If `escape` key is\n * pressed while the input field is focused, the value is reset to the value in the current model.\n *\n * <example name=\"ngModelOptions-directive-blur\" module=\"optionsExample\">\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *     <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n *       <form name=\"userForm\">\n *         <label>\n *           Name:\n *           <input type=\"text\" name=\"userName\"\n *                  ng-model=\"user.name\"\n *                  ng-model-options=\"{ updateOn: 'blur' }\"\n *                  ng-keyup=\"cancel($event)\" />\n *         </label><br />\n *         <label>\n *           Other data:\n *           <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"user.data\" />\n *         </label><br />\n *       </form>\n *       <pre>user.name = <span ng-bind=\"user.name\"></span></pre>\n *     </div>\n *   </file>\n *   <file name=\"app.js\">\n *     angular.module('optionsExample', [])\n *       .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n *         $scope.user = { name: 'say', data: '' };\n *\n *         $scope.cancel = function(e) {\n *           if (e.keyCode === 27) {\n *             $scope.userForm.userName.$rollbackViewValue();\n *           }\n *         };\n *       }]);\n *   </file>\n *   <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n *     var model = element(by.binding('user.name'));\n *     var input = element(by.model('user.name'));\n *     var other = element(by.model('user.data'));\n *\n *     it('should allow custom events', function() {\n *       input.sendKeys(' hello');\n *       input.click();\n *       expect(model.getText()).toEqual('say');\n *       other.click();\n *       expect(model.getText()).toEqual('say hello');\n *     });\n *\n *     it('should $rollbackViewValue when model changes', function() {\n *       input.sendKeys(' hello');\n *       expect(input.getAttribute('value')).toEqual('say hello');\n *       input.sendKeys(protractor.Key.ESCAPE);\n *       expect(input.getAttribute('value')).toEqual('say');\n *       other.click();\n *       expect(model.getText()).toEqual('say');\n *     });\n *   </file>\n * </example>\n *\n * The next example shows how to debounce model changes. Model will be updated only 1 sec after last change.\n * If the `Clear` button is pressed, any debounced action is canceled and the value becomes empty.\n *\n * <example name=\"ngModelOptions-directive-debounce\" module=\"optionsExample\">\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *     <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n *       <form name=\"userForm\">\n *         Name:\n *         <input type=\"text\" name=\"userName\"\n *                ng-model=\"user.name\"\n *                ng-model-options=\"{ debounce: 1000 }\" />\n *         <button ng-click=\"userForm.userName.$rollbackViewValue(); user.name=''\">Clear</button><br />\n *       </form>\n *       <pre>user.name = <span ng-bind=\"user.name\"></span></pre>\n *     </div>\n *   </file>\n *   <file name=\"app.js\">\n *     angular.module('optionsExample', [])\n *       .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n *         $scope.user = { name: 'say' };\n *       }]);\n *   </file>\n * </example>\n *\n * ## Model updates and validation\n *\n * The default behaviour in `ngModel` is that the model value is set to `undefined` when the\n * validation determines that the value is invalid. By setting the `allowInvalid` property to true,\n * the model will still be updated even if the value is invalid.\n *\n *\n * ## Connecting to the scope\n *\n * By setting the `getterSetter` property to true you are telling ngModel that the `ngModel` expression\n * on the scope refers to a \"getter/setter\" function rather than the value itself.\n *\n * The following example shows how to bind to getter/setters:\n *\n * <example name=\"ngModelOptions-directive-getter-setter\" module=\"getterSetterExample\">\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *     <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n *       <form name=\"userForm\">\n *         <label>\n *           Name:\n *           <input type=\"text\" name=\"userName\"\n *                  ng-model=\"user.name\"\n *                  ng-model-options=\"{ getterSetter: true }\" />\n *         </label>\n *       </form>\n *       <pre>user.name = <span ng-bind=\"user.name()\"></span></pre>\n *     </div>\n *   </file>\n *   <file name=\"app.js\">\n *     angular.module('getterSetterExample', [])\n *       .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n *         var _name = 'Brian';\n *         $scope.user = {\n *           name: function(newName) {\n *             return angular.isDefined(newName) ? (_name = newName) : _name;\n *           }\n *         };\n *       }]);\n *   </file>\n * </example>\n *\n *\n * ## Specifying timezones\n *\n * You can specify the timezone that date/time input directives expect by providing its name in the\n * `timezone` property.\n *\n * @param {Object} ngModelOptions options to apply to {@link ngModel} directives on this element and\n *   and its descendents. Valid keys are:\n *   - `updateOn`: string specifying which event should the input be bound to. You can set several\n *     events using an space delimited list. There is a special event called `default` that\n *     matches the default events belonging to the control.\n *   - `debounce`: integer value which contains the debounce model update value in milliseconds. A\n *     value of 0 triggers an immediate update. If an object is supplied instead, you can specify a\n *     custom value for each event. For example:\n *     ```\n *     ng-model-options=\"{\n *       updateOn: 'default blur',\n *       debounce: { 'default': 500, 'blur': 0 }\n *     }\"\n *     ```\n *   - `allowInvalid`: boolean value which indicates that the model can be set with values that did\n *     not validate correctly instead of the default behavior of setting the model to undefined.\n *   - `getterSetter`: boolean value which determines whether or not to treat functions bound to\n *     `ngModel` as getters/setters.\n *   - `timezone`: Defines the timezone to be used to read/write the `Date` instance in the model for\n *     `<input type=\"date\" />`, `<input type=\"time\" />`, ... . It understands UTC/GMT and the\n *     continental US time zone abbreviations, but for general use, use a time zone offset, for\n *     example, `'+0430'` (4 hours, 30 minutes east of the Greenwich meridian)\n *     If not specified, the timezone of the browser will be used.\n *\n */\nvar ngModelOptionsDirective = function() {\n  NgModelOptionsController.$inject = ['$attrs', '$scope'];\n  function NgModelOptionsController($attrs, $scope) {\n    this.$$attrs = $attrs;\n    this.$$scope = $scope;\n  }\n  NgModelOptionsController.prototype = {\n    $onInit: function() {\n      var parentOptions = this.parentCtrl ? this.parentCtrl.$options : defaultModelOptions;\n      var modelOptionsDefinition = this.$$scope.$eval(this.$$attrs.ngModelOptions);\n\n      this.$options = parentOptions.createChild(modelOptionsDefinition);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return {\n    restrict: 'A',\n    // ngModelOptions needs to run before ngModel and input directives\n    priority: 10,\n    require: {parentCtrl: '?^^ngModelOptions'},\n    bindToController: true,\n    controller: NgModelOptionsController\n  };\n};\n\n\n// shallow copy over values from `src` that are not already specified on `dst`\nfunction defaults(dst, src) {\n  forEach(src, function(value, key) {\n    if (!isDefined(dst[key])) {\n      dst[key] = value;\n    }\n  });\n}\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc directive\n * @name ngNonBindable\n * @restrict AC\n * @priority 1000\n * @element ANY\n *\n * @description\n * The `ngNonBindable` directive tells Angular not to compile or bind the contents of the current\n * DOM element.

However, `ngOptions` provides some benefits:\n * - more flexibility in how the `<select>`'s model is assigned via the `select` **`as`** part of the\n * comprehension expression\n * - reduced memory consumption by not creating a new scope for each repeated instance\n * - increased render speed by creating the options in a documentFragment instead of individually\n *\n * When an item in the `<select>` menu is selected, the array element or object property\n * represented by the selected option will be bound to the model identified by the `ngModel`\n * directive.\n *\n * Optionally, a single hard-coded `<option>` element, with the value set to an empty string, can\n * be nested into the `<select>` element. This element will then represent the `null` or \"not selected\"\n * option. See example below for demonstration.\n *\n * ## Complex Models (objects or collections)\n *\n * By default, `ngModel` watches the model by reference, not value. This is important to know when\n * binding the select to a model that is an object or a collection.\n *\n * One issue occurs if you want to preselect an option. For example, if you set\n * the model to an object that is equal to an object in your collection, `ngOptions` won't be able to set the selection,\n * because the objects are not identical. So by default, you should always reference the item in your collection\n * for preselections, e.g.: `$scope.selected = $scope.collection[3]`.\n *\n * Another solution is to use a `track by` clause, because then `ngOptions` will track the identity\n * of the item not by reference, but by the result of the `track by` expression. For example, if your\n * collection items have an id property, you would `track by item.id`.\n *\n * A different issue with objects or collections is that ngModel won't detect if an object property or\n * a collection item changes. For that reason, `ngOptions` additionally watches the model using\n * `$watchCollection`, when the expression contains a `track by` clause or the the select has the `multiple` attribute.\n * This allows ngOptions to trigger a re-rendering of the options even if the actual object/collection\n * has not changed identity, but only a property on the object or an item in the collection changes.\n *\n * Note that `$watchCollection` does a shallow comparison of the properties of the object (or the items in the collection\n * if the model is an array). This means that changing a property deeper than the first level inside the\n * object/collection will not trigger a re-rendering.\n *\n * ## `select` **`as`**\n *\n * Using `select` **`as`** will bind the result of the `select` expression to the model, but\n * the value of the `<select>` and `<option>` html elements will be either the index (for array data sources)\n * or property name (for object data sources) of the value within the collection. If a **`track by`** expression\n * is used, the result of that expression will be set as the value of the `option` and `select` elements.\n *\n *\n * ### `select` **`as`** and **`track by`**\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * Be careful when using `select` **`as`** and **`track by`** in the same expression.\n * </div>\n *\n * Given this array of items on the $scope:\n *\n * ```js\n * $scope.items = [{\n *   id: 1,\n *   label: 'aLabel',\n *   subItem: { name: 'aSubItem' }\n * }, {\n *   id: 2,\n *   label: 'bLabel',\n *   subItem: { name: 'bSubItem' }\n * }];\n * ```\n *\n * This will work:\n *\n * ```html\n * <select ng-options=\"item as item.label for item in items track by item.id\" ng-model=\"selected\"></select>\n * ```\n * ```js\n * $scope.selected = $scope.items[0];\n * ```\n *\n * but this will not work:\n *\n * ```html\n * <select ng-options=\"item.subItem as item.label for item in items track by item.id\" ng-model=\"selected\"></select>\n * ```\n * ```js\n * $scope.selected = $scope.items[0].subItem;\n * ```\n *\n * In both examples, the **`track by`** expression is applied successfully to each `item` in the\n * `items` array. Because the selected option has been set programmatically in the controller, the\n * **`track by`** expression is also applied to the `ngModel` value. In the first example, the\n * `ngModel` value is `items[0]` and the **`track by`** expression evaluates to `items[0].id` with\n * no issue. In the second example, the `ngModel` value is `items[0].subItem` and the **`track by`**\n * expression evaluates to `items[0].subItem.id` (which is undefined).

If not specified, `select` expression will default to `value`.\n *   * `group`: The result of this expression will be used to group options using the `<optgroup>`\n *      DOM element.\n *   * `disable`: The result of this expression will be used to disable the rendered `<option>`\n *      element. Return `true` to disable.\n *   * `trackexpr`: Used when working with an array of objects. The result of this expression will be\n *      used to identify the objects in the array. The `trackexpr` will most likely refer to the\n *     `value` variable (e.g. `value.propertyName`).

Use `ngRequired` instead of\n *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.\n * @param {string=} ngAttrSize sets the size of the select element dynamically.

You configure ngPluralize directive\n * by specifying the mappings between\n * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)\n * and the strings to be displayed.\n *\n * ## Plural categories and explicit number rules\n * There are two\n * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)\n * in Angular's default en-US locale: \"one\" and \"other\".\n *\n * While a plural category may match many numbers (for example, in en-US locale, \"other\" can match\n * any number that is not 1), an explicit number rule can only match one number. For example, the\n * explicit number rule for \"3\" matches the number 3. There are examples of plural categories\n * and explicit number rules throughout the rest of this documentation.\n *\n * ## Configuring ngPluralize\n * You configure ngPluralize by providing 2 attributes: `count` and `when`.\n * You can also provide an optional attribute, `offset`.\n *\n * The value of the `count` attribute can be either a string or an {@link guide/expression\n * Angular expression}; these are evaluated on the current scope for its bound value.\n *\n * The `when` attribute specifies the mappings between plural categories and the actual\n * string to be displayed. The value of the attribute should be a JSON object.\n *\n * The following example shows how to configure ngPluralize:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ng-pluralize count=\"personCount\"\n                 when=\"{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',\n *                      'one': '1 person is viewing.',\n *                      'other': '{} people are viewing.'}\">\n * </ng-pluralize>\n *```\n *\n * In the example, `\"0: Nobody is viewing.\"` is an explicit number rule. If you did not\n * specify this rule, 0 would be matched to the \"other\" category and \"0 people are viewing\"\n * would be shown instead of \"Nobody is viewing\". You can specify an explicit number rule for\n * other numbers, for example 12, so that instead of showing \"12 people are viewing\", you can\n * show \"a dozen people are viewing\".\n *\n * You can use a set of closed braces (`{}`) as a placeholder for the number that you want substituted\n * into pluralized strings. In the previous example, Angular will replace `{}` with\n * <span ng-non-bindable>`{{personCount}}`</span>. The closed braces `{}` is a placeholder\n * for <span ng-non-bindable>{{numberExpression}}</span>.\n *\n * If no rule is defined for a category, then an empty string is displayed and a warning is generated.\n * Note that some locales define more categories than `one` and `other`. For example, fr-fr defines `few` and `many`.\n *\n * ## Configuring ngPluralize with offset\n * The `offset` attribute allows further customization of pluralized text, which can result in\n * a better user experience. For example, instead of the message \"4 people are viewing this document\",\n * you might display \"John, Kate and 2 others are viewing this document\".\n * The offset attribute allows you to offset a number by any desired value.\n * Let's take a look at an example:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ng-pluralize count=\"personCount\" offset=2\n *               when=\"{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',\n *                      '1': '{{person1}} is viewing.',\n *                      '2': '{{person1}} and {{person2}} are viewing.',\n *                      'one': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and one other person are viewing.',\n *                      'other': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and {} other people are viewing.'}\">\n * </ng-pluralize>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that we are still using two plural categories(one, other), but we added\n * three explicit number rules 0, 1 and 2.\n * When one person, perhaps John, views the document, \"John is viewing\" will be shown.\n * When three people view the document, no explicit number rule is found, so\n * an offset of 2 is taken off 3, and Angular uses 1 to decide the plural category.\n * In this case, plural category 'one' is matched and \"John, Mary and one other person are viewing\"\n * is shown.\n *\n * Note that when you specify offsets, you must provide explicit number rules for\n * numbers from 0 up to and including the offset. If you use an offset of 3, for example,\n * you must provide explicit number rules for 0, 1, 2 and 3. You must also provide plural strings for\n * plural categories \"one\" and \"other\".\n *\n * @param {string|expression} count The variable to be bound to.\n * @param {string} when The mapping between plural category to its corresponding strings.\n * @param {number=} offset Offset to deduct from the total number.\n *\n * @example\n    <example module=\"pluralizeExample\" name=\"ng-pluralize\">\n

Browsers generally follow the strategy of providing\n *   keys in the order in which they were defined, although there are exceptions when keys are deleted\n *   and reinstated. See the\n *   [MDN page on `delete` for more info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete#Cross-browser_notes).\n *\n * - `ngRepeat` will silently *ignore* object keys starting with `$`, because\n *   it's a prefix used by Angular for public (`$`) and private (`$$`) properties.\n *\n * - The built-in filters {@link ng.orderBy orderBy} and {@link ng.filter filter} do not work with\n *   objects, and will throw an error if used with one.\n *\n * If you are hitting any of these limitations, the recommended workaround is to convert your object into an array\n * that is sorted into the order that you prefer before providing it to `ngRepeat`. You could\n * do this with a filter such as [toArrayFilter](http://ngmodules.org/modules/angular-toArrayFilter)\n * or implement a `$watch` on the object yourself.\n *\n *\n * ## Tracking and Duplicates\n *\n * `ngRepeat` uses {@link $rootScope.Scope#$watchCollection $watchCollection} to detect changes in\n * the collection. When a change happens, `ngRepeat` then makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n *\n * To minimize creation of DOM elements, `ngRepeat` uses a function\n * to \"keep track\" of all items in the collection and their corresponding DOM elements.\n * For example, if an item is added to the collection, `ngRepeat` will know that all other items\n * already have DOM elements, and will not re-render them.\n *\n * The default tracking function (which tracks items by their identity) does not allow\n * duplicate items in arrays. This is because when there are duplicates, it is not possible\n * to maintain a one-to-one mapping between collection items and DOM elements.\n *\n * If you do need to repeat duplicate items, you can substitute the default tracking behavior\n * with your own using the `track by` expression.\n *\n * For example, you may track items by the index of each item in the collection, using the\n * special scope property `$index`:\n * ```html\n *    <div ng-repeat=\"n in [42, 42, 43, 43] track by $index\">\n *      {{n}}\n *    </div>\n * ```\n *\n * You may also use arbitrary expressions in `track by`, including references to custom functions\n * on the scope:\n * ```html\n *    <div ng-repeat=\"n in [42, 42, 43, 43] track by myTrackingFunction(n)\">\n *      {{n}}\n *    </div>\n * ```\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n * If you are working with objects that have a unique identifier property, you should track\n * by this identifier instead of the object instance. Should you reload your data later, `ngRepeat`\n * will not have to rebuild the DOM elements for items it has already rendered, even if the\n * JavaScript objects in the collection have been substituted for new ones. For large collections,\n * this significantly improves rendering performance. If you don't have a unique identifier,\n * `track by $index` can also provide a performance boost.\n * </div>\n *\n * ```html\n *    <div ng-repeat=\"model in collection track by model.id\">\n *      {{model.name}}\n *    </div>\n * ```\n *\n * <br />\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * Avoid using `track by $index` when the repeated template contains\n * {@link guide/expression#one-time-binding one-time bindings}. In such cases, the `nth` DOM\n * element will always be matched with the `nth` item of the array, so the bindings on that element\n * will not be updated even when the corresponding item changes, essentially causing the view to get\n * out-of-sync with the underlying data.\n * </div>\n *\n * When no `track by` expression is provided, it is equivalent to tracking by the built-in\n * `$id` function, which tracks items by their identity:\n * ```html\n *    <div ng-repeat=\"obj in collection track by $id(obj)\">\n *      {{obj.prop}}\n *    </div>\n * ```\n *\n * <br />\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** `track by` must always be the last expression:\n * </div>\n * ```\n *    <div ng-repeat=\"model in collection | orderBy: 'id' as filtered_result track by model.id\">\n *      {{model.name}}\n *    </div>\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ## Special repeat start and end points\n * To repeat a series of elements instead of just one parent element, ngRepeat (as well as other ng directives) supports extending\n * the range of the repeater by defining explicit start and end points by using **ng-repeat-start** and **ng-repeat-end** respectively.\n * The **ng-repeat-start** directive works the same as **ng-repeat**, but will repeat all the HTML code (including the tag it's defined on)\n * up to and including the ending HTML tag where **ng-repeat-end** is placed.\n *\n * The example below makes use of this feature:\n * ```html\n *   <header ng-repeat-start=\"item in items\">\n *     Header {{ item }}\n *   </header>\n *   <div class=\"body\">\n *     Body {{ item }}\n *   </div>\n *   <footer ng-repeat-end>\n *     Footer {{ item }}\n *   </footer>\n * ```\n *\n * And with an input of {@type ['A','B']} for the items variable in the example above, the output will evaluate to:\n * ```html\n *   <header>\n *     Header A\n *   </header>\n *   <div class=\"body\">\n *     Body A\n *   </div>\n *   <footer>\n *     Footer A\n *   </footer>\n *   <header>\n *     Header B\n *   </header>\n *   <div class=\"body\">\n *     Body B\n *   </div>\n *   <footer>\n *     Footer B\n *   </footer>\n * ```\n *\n * The custom start and end points for ngRepeat also support all other HTML directive syntax flavors provided in AngularJS (such\n * as **data-ng-repeat-start**, **x-ng-repeat-start** and **ng:repeat-start**).\n *\n * @animations\n * | Animation                        | Occurs                              |\n * |----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n * | {@link ng.$animate#enter enter} | when a new item is added to the list or when an item is revealed after a filter |\n * | {@link ng.$animate#leave leave} | when an item is removed from the list or when an item is filtered out |\n * | {@link ng.$animate#move move } | when an adjacent item is filtered out causing a reorder or when the item contents are reordered |\n *\n * See the example below for defining CSS animations with ngRepeat.\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @scope\n * @priority 1000\n * @param {repeat_expression} ngRepeat The expression indicating how to enumerate a collection. These\n *   formats are currently supported:\n *\n *   * `variable in expression` – where variable is the user defined loop variable and `expression`\n *     is a scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.\n *\n *     For example: `album in artist.albums`.\n *\n *   * `(key, value) in expression` – where `key` and `value` can be any user defined identifiers,\n *     and `expression` is the scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.\n *\n *     For example: `(name, age) in {'adam':10, 'amalie':12}`.\n *\n *   * `variable in expression track by tracking_expression` – You can also provide an optional tracking expression\n *     which can be used to associate the objects in the collection with the DOM elements. If no tracking expression\n *     is specified, ng-repeat associates elements by identity. It is an error to have\n *     more than one tracking expression value resolve to the same key. (This would mean that two distinct objects are\n *     mapped to the same DOM element, which is not possible.)\n *\n *     <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n *       <strong>Note:</strong> the `track by` expression must come last - after any filters, and the alias expression.\n *     </div>\n *\n *     For example: `item in items` is equivalent to `item in items track by $id(item)`. This implies that the DOM elements\n *     will be associated by item identity in the array.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items track by $id(item)`. A built in `$id()` function can be used to assign a unique\n *     `$$hashKey` property to each item in the array. This property is then used as a key to associated DOM elements\n *     with the corresponding item in the array by identity. Moving the same object in array would move the DOM\n *     element in the same way in the DOM.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items track by item.id` is a typical pattern when the items come from the database. In this\n *     case the object identity does not matter. Two objects are considered equivalent as long as their `id`\n *     property is same.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items | filter:searchText track by item.id` is a pattern that might be used to apply a filter\n *     to items in conjunction with a tracking expression.\n *\n *   * `variable in expression as alias_expression` – You can also provide an optional alias expression which will then store the\n *     intermediate results of the repeater after the filters have been applied. Typically this is used to render a special message\n *     when a filter is active on the repeater, but the filtered result set is empty.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items | filter:x as results` will store the fragment of the repeated items as `results`, but only after\n *     the items have been processed through the filter.\n *\n *     Please note that `as [variable name] is not an operator but rather a part of ngRepeat micro-syntax so it can be used only at the end\n *     (and not as operator, inside an expression).\n *\n *     For example: `item in items | filter : x | orderBy : order | limitTo : limit as results` .\n *\n * @example\n * This example uses `ngRepeat` to display a list of people. A filter is used to restrict the displayed\n * results by name or by age. New (entering) and removed (leaving) items are animated.\n  <example module=\"ngRepeat\" name=\"ngRepeat\" deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\">\n    <file name=\"index.html\">\n      <div ng-controller=\"repeatController\">\n        I have {{friends.length}} friends.

With static or repeated options, this is\n * the content of the `value` attribute or the textContent of the `<option>`, if the value attribute is missing.\n * Value and textContent can be interpolated.\n *\n * The {@link select.SelectController select controller} exposes utility functions that can be used\n * to manipulate the select's behavior.\n *\n * ## Matching model and option values\n *\n * In general, the match between the model and an option is evaluated by strictly comparing the model\n * value against the value of the available options.\n *\n * If you are setting the option value with the option's `value` attribute, or textContent, the\n * value will always be a `string` which means that the model value must also be a string.\n * Otherwise the `select` directive cannot match them correctly.\n *\n * To bind the model to a non-string value, you can use one of the following strategies:\n * - the {@link ng.ngOptions `ngOptions`} directive\n *   ({@link ng.select#using-select-with-ngoptions-and-setting-a-default-value})\n * - the {@link ng.ngValue `ngValue`} directive, which allows arbitrary expressions to be\n *   option values ({@link ng.select#using-ngvalue-to-bind-the-model-to-an-array-of-objects Example})\n * - model $parsers / $formatters to convert the string value\n *   ({@link ng.select#binding-select-to-a-non-string-value-via-ngmodel-parsing-formatting Example})\n *\n * If the viewValue of `ngModel` does not match any of the options, then the control\n * will automatically add an \"unknown\" option, which it then removes when the mismatch is resolved.\n *\n * Optionally, a single hard-coded `<option>` element, with the value set to an empty string, can\n * be nested into the `<select>` element. This element will then represent the `null` or \"not selected\"\n * option. See example below for demonstration.\n *\n * ## Choosing between `ngRepeat` and `ngOptions`\n *\n * In many cases, `ngRepeat` can be used on `<option>` elements instead of {@link ng.directive:ngOptions\n * ngOptions} to achieve a similar result. However, `ngOptions` provides some benefits:\n * - more flexibility in how the `<select>`'s model is assigned via the `select` **`as`** part of the\n * comprehension expression\n * - reduced memory consumption by not creating a new scope for each repeated instance\n * - increased render speed by creating the options in a documentFragment instead of individually\n *\n * Specifically, select with repeated options slows down significantly starting at 2000 options in\n * Chrome and Internet Explorer / Edge.\n *\n *\n * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.\n * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.\n * @param {string=} multiple Allows multiple options to be selected. The selected values will be\n *     bound to the model as an array.\n * @param {string=} required Sets `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.\n * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds required attribute and required validation constraint to\n * the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use ngRequired instead of required\n * when you want to data-bind to the required attribute.\n * @param {string=} ngChange Angular expression to be executed when selected option(s) changes due to user\n *    interaction with the select element.\n * @param {string=} ngOptions sets the options that the select is populated with and defines what is\n * set on the model on selection. See {@link ngOptions `ngOptions`}.\n * @param {string=} ngAttrSize sets the size of the select element dynamically. Uses the\n * {@link guide/interpolation#-ngattr-for-binding-to-arbitrary-attributes ngAttr} directive.\n *\n *\n * @knownIssue\n *\n * In Firefox, the select model is only updated when the select element is blurred. For example,\n * when switching between options with the keyboard, the select model is only set to the\n * currently selected option when the select is blurred, e.g via tab key or clicking the mouse\n * outside the select.\n *\n * This is due to an ambiguity in the select element specification. See the\n * [issue on the Firefox bug tracker](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=126379)\n * for more information, and this\n * [Github comment for a

If it evaluates to `true`, it sets the\n *                                `required` attribute to the element and adds the `required`\n *                                {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$validators `validator`}.\n *\n * @description\n *\n * ngRequired adds the required {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$validators `validator`} to {@link ngModel `ngModel`}.\n * It is most often used for {@link input `input`} and {@link select `select`} controls, but can also be\n * applied to custom controls.\n *\n * The directive sets the `required` attribute on the element if the Angular expression inside\n * `ngRequired` evaluates to true. A special directive for setting `required` is necessary because we\n * cannot use interpolation inside `required`. See the {@link guide/interpolation interpolation guide}\n * for more info.\n *\n * The validator will set the `required` error key to true if the `required` attribute is set and\n * calling {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$isEmpty `NgModelController.$isEmpty`} with the\n * {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$viewValue `ngModel.$viewValue`} returns `true`. For example, the\n * `$isEmpty()` implementation for `input[text]` checks the length of the `$viewValue`. When developing\n * custom controls, `$isEmpty()` can be overwritten to account for a $viewValue that is not string-based.\n *\n * @example\n * <example name=\"ngRequiredDirective\" module=\"ngRequiredExample\">\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *     <script>\n *       angular.module('ngRequiredExample', [])\n *         .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n *           $scope.required = true;\n *         }]);\n *     </script>\n *     <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n *       <form name=\"form\">\n *         <label for=\"required\">Toggle required: </label>\n *         <input type=\"checkbox\" ng-model=\"required\" id=\"required\" />\n *         <br>\n *         <label for=\"input\">This input must be filled if `required` is true: </label>\n *         <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"model\" id=\"input\" name=\"input\" ng-required=\"required\" /><br>\n *         <hr>\n *         required error set? = <code>{{form.input.$error.required}}</code><br>\n *         model = <code>{{model}}</code>\n *       </form>\n *     </div>\n *   </file>\n *   <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n       var required = element(by.binding('form.input.$error.required'));\n       var model = element(by.binding('model'));\n       var input = element(by.id('input'));\n\n       it('should set the required error', function() {\n         expect(required.getText()).toContain('true');\n\n         input.sendKeys('123');\n         expect(required.getText()).not.toContain('true');\n         expect(model.getText()).toContain('123');\n       });\n *   </file>\n * </example>\n */\nvar requiredDirective = function() {\n  return {\n    restrict: 'A',\n    require: '?ngModel',\n    link: function(scope, elm, attr, ctrl) {\n      if (!ctrl) return;\n      attr.required = true; // force truthy in case we are on non input element\n\n      ctrl.$validators.required = function(modelValue, viewValue) {\n        return !attr.required || !ctrl.$isEmpty(viewValue);\n      };\n\n      attr.$observe('required', function() {\n        ctrl.$validate();\n      });\n    }\n  };\n};\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc directive\n * @name ngPattern\n * @restrict A\n *\n * @param {expression|RegExp} ngPattern AngularJS expression that must evaluate to a `RegExp` or a `String`\n *                                      parsable into a `RegExp`, or a `RegExp` literal.

However, the parsed components will not be set if the URL assigned did not specify\n     * them.  (e.g. if you assign a.href = \"foo\", then a.protocol, a.host, etc. will be empty.)  We\n     * work around that by performing the parsing in a 2nd step by taking a previously normalized\n     * URL (e.g. by assigning to a.href) and assigning it a.href again.

The purpose of `$animateCss` is NOT\n * to side-step how `$animate` and ngAnimate work, but the goal is to allow pre-existing animations or\n * directives to create more complex animations that can be purely driven using CSS code.\n *\n * Note that only browsers that support CSS transitions and/or keyframe animations are capable of\n * rendering animations triggered via `$animateCss` (bad news for IE9 and lower).\n *\n * ## General Use\n * Once again, `$animateCss` is designed to be used inside of a registered JavaScript animation that\n * is powered by ngAnimate. It is possible to use `$animateCss` directly inside of a directive, however,\n * any automatic control over cancelling animations and/or preventing animations from being run on\n * child elements will not be handled by Angular. For this to work as expected, please use `$animate` to\n * trigger the animation and then setup a JavaScript animation that injects `$animateCss` to trigger\n * the CSS animation.\n *\n * The example below shows how we can create a folding animation on an element using `ng-if`:\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- notice the `fold-animation` CSS class -->\n * <div ng-if=\"onOff\" class=\"fold-animation\">\n *   This element will go BOOM\n * </div>\n * <button ng-click=\"onOff=true\">Fold In</button>\n * ```\n *\n * Now we create the **JavaScript animation** that will trigger the CSS transition:\n *\n * ```js\n * ngModule.animation('.fold-animation', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {\n *   return {\n *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {\n *       var height = element[0].offsetHeight;\n *       return $animateCss(element, {\n *         from: { height:'0px' },\n *         to: { height:height + 'px' },\n *         duration: 1 // one second\n *       });\n *     }\n *   }\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * ## More Advanced Uses\n *\n * `$animateCss` is the underlying code that ngAnimate uses to power **CSS-based animations** behind the scenes. Therefore CSS hooks\n * like `.ng-EVENT`, `.ng-EVENT-active`, `.ng-EVENT-stagger` are all features that can be triggered using `$animateCss` via JavaScript code.\n *\n * This also means that just about any combination of adding classes, removing classes, setting styles, dynamically setting a keyframe animation,\n * applying a hardcoded duration or delay value, changing the animation easing or applying a stagger animation are all options that work with\n * `$animateCss`. The service itself is smart enough to figure out the combination of options and examine the element styling properties in order\n * to provide a working animation that will run in CSS.\n *\n * The example below showcases a more advanced version of the `.fold-animation` from the example above:\n *\n * ```js\n * ngModule.animation('.fold-animation', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {\n *   return {\n *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {\n *       var height = element[0].offsetHeight;\n *       return $animateCss(element, {\n *         addClass: 'red large-text pulse-twice',\n *         easing: 'ease-out',\n *         from: { height:'0px' },\n *         to: { height:height + 'px' },\n *         duration: 1 // one second\n *       });\n *     }\n *   }\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * Since we're adding/removing CSS classes then the CSS transition will also pick those up:\n *\n * ```css\n * /&#42; since a hardcoded duration value of 1 was provided in the JavaScript animation code,\n * the CSS classes below will be transitioned despite them being defined as regular CSS classes &#42;/\n * .red { background:red; }\n * .large-text { font-size:20px; }\n *\n * /&#42; we can also use a keyframe animation and $animateCss will make it work alongside the transition &#42;/\n * .pulse-twice {\n *   animation: 0.5s pulse linear 2;\n *   -webkit-animation: 0.5s pulse linear 2;\n * }\n *\n * @keyframes pulse {\n *   from { transform: scale(0.5); }\n *   to { transform: scale(1.5); }\n * }\n *\n * @-webkit-keyframes pulse {\n *   from { -webkit-transform: scale(0.5); }\n *   to { -webkit-transform: scale(1.5); }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Given this complex combination of CSS classes, styles and options, `$animateCss` will figure everything out and make the animation happen.\n *\n * ## How the Options are handled\n *\n * `$animateCss` is very versatile and intelligent when it comes to figuring out what configurations to apply to the element to ensure the animation\n * works with the options provided. Say for example we were adding a class that contained a keyframe value and we wanted to also animate some inline\n * styles using the `from` and `to` properties.\n *\n * ```js\n * var animator = $animateCss(element, {\n *   from: { background:'red' },\n *   to: { background:'blue' }\n * });\n * animator.start();\n * ```\n *\n * ```css\n * .rotating-animation {\n *   animation:0.5s rotate linear;\n *   -webkit-animation:0.5s rotate linear;\n * }\n *\n * @keyframes rotate {\n *   from { transform: rotate(0deg); }\n *   to { transform: rotate(360deg); }\n * }\n *\n * @-webkit-keyframes rotate {\n *   from { -webkit-transform: rotate(0deg); }\n *   to { -webkit-transform: rotate(360deg); }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The missing pieces here are that we do not have a transition set (within the CSS code nor within the `$animateCss` options) and the duration of the animation is\n * going to be detected from what the keyframe styles on the CSS class are. In this event, `$animateCss` will automatically create an inline transition\n * style matching the duration detected from the keyframe style (which is present in the CSS class that is being added) and then prepare both the transition\n * and keyframe animations to run in parallel on the element. Then when the animation is underway the provided `from` and `to` CSS styles will be applied\n * and spread across the transition and keyframe animation.\n *\n * ## What is returned\n *\n * `$animateCss` works in two stages: a preparation phase and an animation phase. Therefore when `$animateCss` is first called it will NOT actually\n * start the animation. All that is going on here is that the element is being prepared for the animation (which means that the generated CSS classes are\n * added and removed on the element). Once `$animateCss` is called it will return an object with the following properties:\n *\n * ```js\n * var animator = $animateCss(element, { ... });\n * ```\n *\n * Now what do the contents of our `animator` variable look like:\n *\n * ```js\n * {\n *   // starts the animation\n *   start: Function,\n *\n *   // ends (aborts) the animation\n *   end: Function\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * To actually start the animation we need to run `animation.start()` which will then return a promise that we can hook into to detect when the animation ends.\n * If we choose not to run the animation then we MUST run `animation.end()` to perform a cleanup on the element (since some CSS classes and styles may have been\n * applied to the element during the preparation phase). Note that all other properties such as duration, delay, transitions and keyframes are just properties\n * and that changing them will not reconfigure the parameters of the animation.\n *\n * ### runner.done() vs runner.then()\n * It is documented that `animation.start()` will return a promise object and this is true, however, there is also an additional method available on the\n * runner called `.done(callbackFn)`. The done method works the same as `.finally(callbackFn)`, however, it does **not trigger a digest to occur**.\n * Therefore, for performance reasons, it's always best to use `runner.done(callback)` instead of `runner.then()`, `runner.catch()` or `runner.finally()`\n * unless you really need a digest to kick off afterwards.\n *\n * Keep in mind that, to make this easier, ngAnimate has tweaked the JS animations API to recognize when a runner instance is returned from $animateCss\n * (so there is no need to call `runner.done(doneFn)` inside of your JavaScript animation code).\n * Check the {@link ngAnimate.$animateCss#usage animation code above} to see how this works.\n *\n * @param {DOMElement} element the element that will be animated\n * @param {object} options the animation-related options that will be applied during the animation\n *\n * * `event` - The DOM event (e.g. enter, leave, move). When used, a generated CSS class of `ng-EVENT` and `ng-EVENT-active` will be applied\n * to the element during the animation. Multiple events can be provided when spaces are used as a separator. (Note that this will not perform any DOM operation.)\n * * `structural` - Indicates that the `ng-` prefix will be added to the event class. Setting to `false` or omitting will turn `ng-EVENT` and\n * `ng-EVENT-active` in `EVENT` and `EVENT-active`. Unused if `event` is omitted.\n * * `easing` - The CSS easing value that will be applied to the transition or keyframe animation (or both).\n * * `transitionStyle` - The raw CSS transition style that will be used (e.g. `1s linear all`).\n * * `keyframeStyle` - The raw CSS keyframe animation style that will be used (e.g. `1s my_animation linear`).\n * * `from` - The starting CSS styles (a key/value object) that will be applied at the start of the animation.\n * * `to` - The ending CSS styles (a key/value object) that will be applied across the animation via a CSS transition.\n * * `addClass` - A space separated list of CSS classes that will be added to the element and spread across the animation.\n * * `removeClass` - A space separated list of CSS classes that will be removed from the element and spread across the animation.\n * * `duration` - A number value representing the total duration of the transition and/or keyframe (note that a value of 1 is 1000ms). If a value of `0`\n * is provided then the animation will be skipped entirely.\n * * `delay` - A number value representing the total delay of the transition and/or keyframe (note that a value of 1 is 1000ms). If a value of `true` is\n * used then whatever delay value is detected from the CSS classes will be mirrored on the elements styles (e.g. by setting delay true then the style value\n * of the element will be `transition-delay: DETECTED_VALUE`). Using `true` is useful when you want the CSS classes and inline styles to all share the same\n * CSS delay value.\n * * `stagger` - A numeric time value representing the delay between successively animated elements\n * ({@link ngAnimate#css-staggering-animations Click here to learn how CSS-based staggering works in ngAnimate.})\n * * `staggerIndex` - The numeric index representing the stagger item (e.g. a value of 5 is equal to the sixth item in the stagger; therefore when a\n *   `stagger` option value of `0.1` is used then there will be a stagger delay of `600ms`)\n * * `applyClassesEarly` - Whether or not the classes being added or removed will be used when detecting the animation. This is set by `$animate` when enter/leave/move animations are fired to ensure that the CSS classes are resolved in time. (Note that this will prevent any transitions from occurring on the classes being added and removed.)\n * * `cleanupStyles` - Whether or not the provided `from` and `to` styles will be removed once\n *    the animation is closed. This is useful for when the styles are used purely for the sake of\n *    the animation and do not have a lasting visual effect on the element (e.g. a collapse and open animation).\n *    By default this value is set to `false`.\n *\n * @return {object} an object with start and end methods and details about the animation.\n *\n * * `start` - The method to start the animation. This will return a `Promise` when called.\n * * `end` - This method will cancel the animation and remove all applied CSS classes and styles.\n */\nvar ONE_SECOND = 1000;\n\nvar ELAPSED_TIME_MAX_DECIMAL_PLACES = 3;\nvar CLOSING_TIME_BUFFER = 1.5;\n\nvar DETECT_CSS_PROPERTIES = {\n  transitionDuration:      TRANSITION_DURATION_PROP,\n  transitionDelay:         TRANSITION_DELAY_PROP,\n  transitionProperty:      TRANSITION_PROP + PROPERTY_KEY,\n  animationDuration:       ANIMATION_DURATION_PROP,\n  animationDelay:          ANIMATION_DELAY_PROP,\n  animationIterationCount: ANIMATION_PROP + ANIMATION_ITERATION_COUNT_KEY\n};\n\nvar DETECT_STAGGER_CSS_PROPERTIES = {\n  transitionDuration:      TRANSITION_DURATION_PROP,\n  transitionDelay:         TRANSITION_DELAY_PROP,\n  animationDuration:       ANIMATION_DURATION_PROP,\n  animationDelay:          ANIMATION_DELAY_PROP\n};\n\nfunction getCssKeyframeDurationStyle(duration) {\n  return [ANIMATION_DURATION_PROP, duration + 's'];\n}\n\nfunction getCssDelayStyle(delay, isKeyframeAnimation) {\n  var prop = isKeyframeAnimation ?

Animations are not enabled by default, however, by including `ngAnimate` the animation hooks are enabled for an Angular app.\n *\n * ## Usage\n * Simply put, there are two ways to make use of animations when ngAnimate is used: by using **CSS** and **JavaScript**. The former works purely based\n * using CSS (by using matching CSS selectors/styles) and the latter triggers animations that are registered via `module.animation()`. For\n * both CSS and JS animations the sole requirement is to have a matching `CSS class` that exists both in the registered animation and within\n * the HTML element that the animation will be triggered on.\n *\n * ## Directive Support\n * The following directives are \"animation aware\":\n *\n * | Directive                                                                                                | Supported Animations                                                     |\n * |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n * | {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat#animations ngRepeat}                                                        | enter, leave and move                                                    |\n * | {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView#animations ngView}                                                       | enter and leave                                                          |\n * | {@link ng.directive:ngInclude#animations ngInclude}                                                      | enter and leave                                                          |\n * | {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch#animations ngSwitch}                                                        | enter and leave                                                          |\n * | {@link ng.directive:ngIf#animations ngIf}                                                                | enter and leave                                                          |\n * | {@link ng.directive:ngClass#animations ngClass}                                                          | add and remove (the CSS class(es) present)                               |\n * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow#animations ngShow} & {@link ng.directive:ngHide#animations ngHide}            | add and remove (the ng-hide class value)                                 |\n * | {@link ng.directive:form#animations form} & {@link ng.directive:ngModel#animations ngModel}    | add and remove (dirty, pristine, valid, invalid & all other validations) |\n * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessages}                                                          | add and remove (ng-active & ng-inactive)                                 |\n * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessage}                                                           | enter and leave                                                          |\n *\n * (More information can be found by visiting each the documentation associated with each directive.)\n *\n * ## CSS-based Animations\n *\n * CSS-based animations with ngAnimate are unique since they require no JavaScript code at all. By using a CSS class that we reference between our HTML\n * and CSS code we can create an animation that will be picked up by Angular when an underlying directive performs an operation.\n *\n * The example below shows how an `enter` animation can be made possible on an element using `ng-if`:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-if=\"bool\" class=\"fade\">\n *    Fade me in out\n * </div>\n * <button ng-click=\"bool=true\">Fade In!</button>\n * <button ng-click=\"bool=false\">Fade Out!</button>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice the CSS class **fade**? We can now create the CSS transition code that references this class:\n *\n * ```css\n * /&#42; The starting CSS styles for the enter animation &#42;/\n * .fade.ng-enter {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   opacity:0;\n * }\n *\n * /&#42; The finishing CSS styles for the enter animation &#42;/\n * .fade.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n *   opacity:1;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The key thing to remember here is that, depending on the animation event (which each of the directives above trigger depending on what's going on) two\n * generated CSS classes will be applied to the element; in the example above we have `.ng-enter` and `.ng-enter-active`. For CSS transitions, the transition\n * code **must** be defined within the starting CSS class (in this case `.ng-enter`). The destination class is what the transition will animate towards.\n *\n * If for example we wanted to create animations for `leave` and `move` (ngRepeat triggers move) then we can do so using the same CSS naming conventions:\n *\n * ```css\n * /&#42; now the element will fade out before it is removed from the DOM &#42;/\n * .fade.ng-leave {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   opacity:1;\n * }\n * .fade.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {\n *   opacity:0;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We can also make use of **CSS Keyframes** by referencing the keyframe animation within the starting CSS class:\n *\n * ```css\n * /&#42; there is no need to define anything inside of the destination\n * CSS class since the keyframe will take charge of the animation &#42;/\n * .fade.ng-leave {\n *   animation: my_fade_animation 0.5s linear;\n *   -webkit-animation: my_fade_animation 0.5s linear;\n * }\n *\n * @keyframes my_fade_animation {\n *   from { opacity:1; }\n *   to { opacity:0; }\n * }\n *\n * @-webkit-keyframes my_fade_animation {\n *   from { opacity:1; }\n *   to { opacity:0; }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Feel free also mix transitions and keyframes together as well as any other CSS classes on the same element.\n *\n * ### CSS Class-based Animations\n *\n * Class-based animations (animations that are triggered via `ngClass`, `ngShow`, `ngHide` and some other directives) have a slightly different\n * naming convention. Class-based animations are basic enough that a standard transition or keyframe can be referenced on the class being added\n * and removed.\n *\n * For example if we wanted to do a CSS animation for `ngHide` then we place an animation on the `.ng-hide` CSS class:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-show=\"bool\" class=\"fade\">\n *   Show and hide me\n * </div>\n * <button ng-click=\"bool=!bool\">Toggle</button>\n *\n * <style>\n * .fade.ng-hide {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   opacity:0;\n * }\n * </style>\n * ```\n *\n * All that is going on here with ngShow/ngHide behind the scenes is the `.ng-hide` class is added/removed (when the hidden state is valid). Since\n * ngShow and ngHide are animation aware then we can match up a transition and ngAnimate handles the rest.\n *\n * In addition the addition and removal of the CSS class, ngAnimate also provides two helper methods that we can use to further decorate the animation\n * with CSS styles.\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-class=\"{on:onOff}\" class=\"highlight\">\n *   Highlight this box\n * </div>\n * <button ng-click=\"onOff=!onOff\">Toggle</button>\n *\n * <style>\n * .highlight {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n * }\n * .highlight.on-add {\n *   background:white;\n * }\n * .highlight.on {\n *   background:yellow;\n * }\n * .highlight.on-remove {\n *   background:black;\n * }\n * </style>\n * ```\n *\n * We can also make use of CSS keyframes by placing them within the CSS classes.\n *\n *\n * ### CSS Staggering Animations\n * A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a\n * curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module (versions >=1.2) supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be\n * performed by creating a **ng-EVENT-stagger** CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for\n * the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a **transition-delay** or an\n * **animation-delay** property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).\n *\n * ```css\n * .my-animation.ng-enter {\n *   /&#42; standard transition code &#42;/\n *   transition: 1s linear all;\n *   opacity:0;\n * }\n * .my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {\n *   /&#42; this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation &#42;/\n *   transition-delay: 0.1s;\n *\n *   /&#42; As of 1.4.4, this must always be set: it signals ngAnimate\n *     to not accidentally inherit a delay property from another CSS class &#42;/\n *   transition-duration: 0s;\n *\n *   /&#42; if you are using animations instead of transitions you should configure as follows:\n *     animation-delay: 0.1s;\n *     animation-duration: 0s; &#42;/\n * }\n * .my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n *   /&#42; standard transition styles &#42;/\n *   opacity:1;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations\n * on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this\n * are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation\n * will also be reset if one or more animation frames have passed since the multiple calls to `$animate` were fired.\n *\n * The following code will issue the **ng-leave-stagger** event on the element provided:\n *\n * ```js\n * var kids = parent.children();\n *\n * $animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0\n * $animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1\n * $animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2\n * $animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3\n * $animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4\n *\n * window.requestAnimationFrame(function() {\n *   //stagger has reset itself\n *   $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0\n *   $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1\n *\n *   $scope.$digest();\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.\n *\n * ### The `ng-animate` CSS class\n *\n * When ngAnimate is animating an element it will apply the `ng-animate` CSS class to the element for the duration of the animation.\n * This is a temporary CSS class and it will be removed once the animation is over (for both JavaScript and CSS-based animations).\n *\n * Therefore, animations can be applied to an element using this temporary class directly via CSS.\n *\n * ```css\n * .zipper.ng-animate {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n * }\n * .zipper.ng-enter {\n *   opacity:0;\n * }\n * .zipper.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n *   opacity:1;\n * }\n * .zipper.ng-leave {\n *   opacity:1;\n * }\n * .zipper.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {\n *   opacity:0;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * (Note that the `ng-animate` CSS class is reserved and it cannot be applied on an element directly since ngAnimate will always remove\n * the CSS class once an animation has completed.)\n *\n *\n * ### The `ng-[event]-prepare` class\n *\n * This is a special class that can be used to prevent unwanted flickering / flash of content before\n * the actual animation starts. The class is added as soon as an animation is initialized, but removed\n * before the actual animation starts (after waiting for a $digest).\n * It is also only added for *structural* animations (`enter`, `move`, and `leave`).\n *\n * In practice, flickering can appear when nesting elements with structural animations such as `ngIf`\n * into elements that have class-based animations such as `ngClass`.\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-class=\"{red: myProp}\">\n *   <div ng-class=\"{blue: myProp}\">\n *     <div class=\"message\" ng-if=\"myProp\"></div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * It is possible that during the `enter` animation, the `.message` div will be briefly visible before it starts animating.\n * In that case, you can add styles to the CSS that make sure the element stays hidden before the animation starts:\n *\n * ```css\n * .message.ng-enter-prepare {\n *   opacity: 0;\n * }\n *\n * ```\n *\n * ## JavaScript-based Animations\n *\n * ngAnimate also allows for animations to be consumed by JavaScript code. The approach is similar to CSS-based animations (where there is a shared\n * CSS class that is referenced in our HTML code) but in addition we need to register the JavaScript animation on the module. By making use of the\n * `module.animation()` module function we can register the animation.\n *\n * Let's see an example of a enter/leave animation using `ngRepeat`:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-repeat=\"item in items\" class=\"slide\">\n *   {{ item }}\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * See the **slide** CSS class? Let's use that class to define an animation that we'll structure in our module code by using `module.animation`:\n *\n * ```js\n * myModule.animation('.slide', [function() {\n *   return {\n *     // make note that other events (like addClass/removeClass)\n *     // have different function input parameters\n *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {\n *       jQuery(element).fadeIn(1000, doneFn);\n *\n *       // remember to call doneFn so that angular\n *       // knows that the animation has concluded\n *     },\n *\n *     move: function(element, doneFn) {\n *       jQuery(element).fadeIn(1000, doneFn);\n *     },\n *\n *     leave: function(element, doneFn) {\n *       jQuery(element).fadeOut(1000, doneFn);\n *     }\n *   }\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * The nice thing about JS-based animations is that we can inject other services and make use of advanced animation libraries such as\n * greensock.js and velocity.js.\n *\n * If our animation code class-based (meaning that something like `ngClass`, `ngHide` and `ngShow` triggers it) then we can still define\n * our animations inside of the same registered animation, however, the function input arguments are a bit different:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-class=\"color\" class=\"colorful\">\n *   this box is moody\n * </div>\n * <button ng-click=\"color='red'\">Change to red</button>\n * <button ng-click=\"color='blue'\">Change to blue</button>\n * <button ng-click=\"color='green'\">Change to green</button>\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * myModule.animation('.colorful', [function() {\n *   return {\n *     addClass: function(element, className, doneFn) {\n *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn\n *     },\n *     removeClass: function(element, className, doneFn) {\n *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn\n *     },\n *     setClass: function(element, addedClass, removedClass, doneFn) {\n *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn\n *     }\n *   }\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * ## CSS + JS Animations Together\n *\n * AngularJS 1.4 and higher has taken steps to make the amalgamation of CSS and JS animations more flexible. However, unlike earlier versions of Angular,\n * defining CSS and JS animations to work off of the same CSS class will not work anymore. Therefore the example below will only result in **JS animations taking\n * charge of the animation**:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-if=\"bool\" class=\"slide\">\n *   Slide in and out\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * myModule.animation('.slide', [function() {\n *   return {\n *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {\n *       jQuery(element).slideIn(1000, doneFn);\n *     }\n *   }\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * ```css\n * .slide.ng-enter {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   transform:translateY(-100px);\n * }\n * .slide.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n *   transform:translateY(0);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Does this mean that CSS and JS animations cannot be used together? Do JS-based animations always have higher priority? We can make up for the\n * lack of CSS animations by using the `$animateCss` service to trigger our own tweaked-out, CSS-based animations directly from\n * our own JS-based animation code:\n *\n * ```js\n * myModule.animation('.slide', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {\n *   return {\n *     enter: function(element) {\n*        // this will trigger `.slide.ng-enter` and `.slide.ng-enter-active`.\n *       return $animateCss(element, {\n *         event: 'enter',\n *         structural: true\n *       });\n *     }\n *   }\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * The nice thing here is that we can save bandwidth by sticking to our CSS-based animation code and we don't need to rely on a 3rd-party animation framework.\n *\n * The `$animateCss` service is very powerful since we can feed in all kinds of extra properties that will be evaluated and fed into a CSS transition or\n * keyframe animation. For example if we wanted to animate the height of an element while adding and removing classes then we can do so by providing that\n * data into `$animateCss` directly:\n *\n * ```js\n * myModule.animation('.slide', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {\n *   return {\n *     enter: function(element) {\n *       return $animateCss(element, {\n *         event: 'enter',\n *         structural: true,\n *         addClass: 'maroon-setting',\n *         from: { height:0 },\n *         to: { height: 200 }\n *       });\n *     }\n *   }\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * Now we can fill in the rest via our transition CSS code:\n *\n * ```css\n * /&#42; the transition tells ngAnimate to make the animation happen &#42;/\n * .slide.ng-enter { transition:0.5s linear all; }\n *\n * /&#42; this extra CSS class will be absorbed into the transition\n * since the $animateCss code is adding the class &#42;/\n * .maroon-setting { background:red; }\n * ```\n *\n * And `$animateCss` will figure out the rest. Just make sure to have the `done()` callback fire the `doneFn` function to signal when the animation is over.\n *\n * To learn more about what's possible be sure to visit the {@link ngAnimate.$animateCss $animateCss service}.\n *\n * ## Animation Anchoring (via `ng-animate-ref`)\n *\n * ngAnimate in AngularJS 1.4 comes packed with the ability to cross-animate elements between\n * structural areas of an application (like views) by pairing up elements using an attribute\n * called `ng-animate-ref`.\n *\n * Let's say for example we have two views that are managed by `ng-view` and we want to show\n * that there is a relationship between two components situated in within these views. By using the\n * `ng-animate-ref` attribute we can identify that the two components are paired together and we\n * can then attach an animation, which is triggered when the view changes.\n *\n * Say for example we have the following template code:\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- index.html -->\n * <div ng-view class=\"view-animation\">\n * </div>\n *\n * <!-- home.html -->\n * <a href=\"#/banner-page\">\n *   <img src=\"./banner.jpg\" class=\"banner\" ng-animate-ref=\"banner\">\n * </a>\n *\n * <!-- banner-page.html -->\n * <img src=\"./banner.jpg\" class=\"banner\" ng-animate-ref=\"banner\">\n * ```\n *\n * Now, when the view changes (once the link is clicked), ngAnimate will examine the\n * HTML contents to see if there is a match reference between any components in the view\n * that is leaving and the view that is entering. It will scan both the view which is being\n * removed (leave) and inserted (enter) to see if there are any paired DOM elements that\n * contain a matching ref value.\n *\n * The two images match since they share the same ref value. ngAnimate will now create a\n * transport element (which is a clone of the first image element) and it will then attempt\n * to animate to the position of the second image element in the next view. For the animation to\n * work a special CSS class called `ng-anchor` will be added to the transported element.\n *\n * We can now attach a transition onto the `.banner.ng-anchor` CSS class and then\n * ngAnimate will handle the entire transition for us as well as the addition and removal of\n * any changes of CSS classes between the elements:\n *\n * ```css\n * .banner.ng-anchor {\n *   /&#42; this animation will last for 1 second since there are\n *          two phases to the animation (an `in` and an `out` phase) &#42;/\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We also **must** include animations for the views that are being entered and removed\n * (otherwise anchoring wouldn't be possible since the new view would be inserted right away).\n *\n * ```css\n * .view-animation.ng-enter, .view-animation.ng-leave {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   position:fixed;\n *   left:0;\n *   top:0;\n *   width:100%;\n * }\n * .view-animation.ng-enter {\n *   transform:translateX(100%);\n * }\n * .view-animation.ng-leave,\n * .view-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n *   transform:translateX(0%);\n * }\n * .view-animation.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {\n *   transform:translateX(-100%);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Now we can jump back to the anchor animation. When the animation happens, there are two stages that occur:\n * an `out` and an `in` stage. The `out` stage happens first and that is when the element is animated away\n * from its origin. Once that animation is over then the `in` stage occurs which animates the\n * element to its destination. The reason why there are two animations is to give enough time\n * for the enter animation on the new element to be ready.\n *\n * The example above sets up a transition for both the in and out phases, but we can also target the out or\n * in phases directly via `ng-anchor-out` and `ng-anchor-in`.\n *\n * ```css\n * .banner.ng-anchor-out {\n *   transition: 0.5s linear all;\n *\n *   /&#42; the scale will be applied during the out animation,\n *          but will be animated away when the in animation runs &#42;/\n *   transform: scale(1.2);\n * }\n *\n * .banner.ng-anchor-in {\n *   transition: 1s linear all;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n *\n *\n *\n * ### Anchoring Demo\n *\n  <example module=\"anchoringExample\"\n           name=\"anchoringExample\"\n           id=\"anchoringExample\"\n           deps=\"angular-animate.js;angular-route.js\"\n           animations=\"true\">\n    <file name=\"index.html\">\n      <a href=\"#!/\">Home</a>\n      <hr />\n      <div class=\"view-container\">\n        <div ng-view class=\"view\"></div>\n      </div>\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"script.js\">\n      angular.module('anchoringExample', ['ngAnimate', 'ngRoute'])\n        .config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {\n          $routeProvider.when('/', {\n            templateUrl: 'home.html',\n            controller: 'HomeController as home'\n          });\n          $routeProvider.when('/profile/:id', {\n            templateUrl: 'profile.html',\n            controller: 'ProfileController as profile'\n          });\n        }])\n        .run(['$rootScope', function($rootScope) {\n          $rootScope.records = [\n            { id: 1, title: 'Miss Beulah Roob' },\n            { id: 2, title: 'Trent Morissette' },\n            { id: 3, title: 'Miss Ava Pouros' },\n            { id: 4, title: 'Rod Pouros' },\n            { id: 5, title: 'Abdul Rice' },\n            { id: 6, title: 'Laurie Rutherford Sr.' },\n            { id: 7, title: 'Nakia McLaughlin' },\n            { id: 8, title: 'Jordon Blanda DVM' },\n            { id: 9, title: 'Rhoda Hand' },\n            { id: 10, title: 'Alexandrea Sauer' }\n          ];\n        }])\n        .controller('HomeController', [function() {\n          //empty\n        }])\n        .controller('ProfileController', ['$rootScope', '$routeParams',\n            function ProfileController($rootScope, $routeParams) {\n          var index = parseInt($routeParams.id, 10);\n          var record = $rootScope.records[index - 1];\n\n          this.title = record.title;\n          this.id = record.id;\n        }]);\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"home.html\">\n      <h2>Welcome to the home page</h1>\n      <p>Please click on an element</p>\n      <a class=\"record\"\n         ng-href=\"#!/profile/{{ record.id }}\"\n         ng-animate-ref=\"{{ record.id }}\"\n         ng-repeat=\"record in records\">\n        {{ record.title }}\n      </a>\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"profile.html\">\n      <div class=\"profile record\" ng-animate-ref=\"{{ profile.id }}\">\n        {{ profile.title }}\n      </div>\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"animations.css\">\n      .record {\n        display:block;\n        font-size:20px;\n      }\n      .profile {\n        background:black;\n        color:white;\n        font-size:100px;\n      }\n      .view-container {\n        position:relative;\n      }\n      .view-container > .view.ng-animate {\n        position:absolute;\n        top:0;\n        left:0;\n        width:100%;\n        min-height:500px;\n      }\n      .view.ng-enter, .view.ng-leave,\n      .record.ng-anchor {\n        transition:0.5s linear all;\n      }\n      .view.ng-enter {\n        transform:translateX(100%);\n      }\n      .view.ng-enter.ng-enter-active, .view.ng-leave {\n        transform:translateX(0%);\n      }\n      .view.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {\n        transform:translateX(-100%);\n      }\n      .record.ng-anchor-out {\n        background:red;\n      }\n    </file>\n  </example>\n *\n * ### How is the element transported?\n *\n * When an anchor animation occurs, ngAnimate will clone the starting element and position it exactly where the starting\n * element is located on screen via absolute positioning. The cloned element will be placed inside of the root element\n * of the application (where ng-app was defined) and all of the CSS classes of the starting element will be applied. The\n * element will then animate into the `out` and `in` animations and will eventually reach the coordinates and match\n * the dimensions of the destination element. During the entire animation a CSS class of `.ng-animate-shim` will be applied\n * to both the starting and destination elements in order to hide them from being visible (the CSS styling for the class\n * is: `visibility:hidden`). Once the anchor reaches its destination then it will be removed and the destination element\n * will become visible since the shim class will be removed.\n *\n * ### How is the morphing handled?\n *\n * CSS Anchoring relies on transitions and keyframes and the internal code is intelligent enough to figure out\n * what CSS classes differ between the starting element and the destination element. These different CSS classes\n * will be added/removed on the anchor element and a transition will be applied (the transition that is provided\n * in the anchor class). Long story short, ngAnimate will figure out what classes to add and remove which will\n * make the transition of the element as smooth and automatic as possible. Be sure to use simple CSS classes that\n * do not rely on DOM nesting structure so that the anchor element appears the same as the starting element (since\n * the cloned element is placed inside of root element which is likely close to the body element).\n *\n * Note that if the root element is on the `<html>` element then the cloned node will be placed inside of body.\n *\n *\n * ## Using $animate in your directive code\n *\n * So far we've explored how to feed in animations into an Angular application, but how do we trigger animations within our own directives in our application?\n * By injecting the `$animate` service into our directive code, we can trigger structural and class-based hooks which can then be consumed by animations. Let's\n * imagine we have a greeting box that shows and hides itself when the data changes\n *\n * ```html\n * <greeting-box active=\"onOrOff\">Hi there</greeting-box>\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * ngModule.directive('greetingBox', ['$animate', function($animate) {\n *   return function(scope, element, attrs) {\n *     attrs.$observe('active', function(value) {\n *       value ? $animate.addClass(element, 'on') : $animate.removeClass(element, 'on');\n *     });\n *   });\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * Now the `on` CSS class is added and removed on the greeting box component. Now if we add a CSS class on top of the greeting box element\n * in our HTML code then we can trigger a CSS or JS animation to happen.\n *\n * ```css\n * /&#42; normally we would create a CSS class to reference on the element &#42;/\n * greeting-box.on { transition:0.5s linear all; background:green; color:white; }\n * ```\n *\n * The `$animate` service contains a variety of other methods like `enter`, `leave`, `animate` and `setClass`. To learn more about what's\n * possible be sure to visit the {@link ng.$animate $animate service API page}.\n *\n *\n * ## Callbacks and Promises\n *\n * When `$animate` is called it returns a promise that can be used to capture when the animation has ended. Therefore if we were to trigger\n * an animation (within our directive code) then we can continue performing directive and scope related activities after the animation has\n * ended by chaining onto the returned promise that animation method returns.\n *\n * ```js\n * // somewhere within the depths of the directive\n * $animate.enter(element, parent).then(function() {\n *   //the animation has completed\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * (Note that earlier versions of Angular prior to v1.4 required the promise code to be wrapped using `$scope.$apply(...)`. This is not the case\n * anymore.)\n *\n * In addition to the animation promise, we can also make use of animation-related callbacks within our directives and controller code by registering\n * an event listener using the `$animate` service.

provides enhanced support for displaying messages within templates\n * (typically within forms or when rendering message objects that return key/value data).\n * Instead of relying on JavaScript code and/or complex ng-if statements within your form template to\n * show and hide error messages specific to the state of an input field, the `ngMessages` and\n * `ngMessage` directives are designed to handle the complexity, inheritance and priority\n * sequencing based on the order of how the messages are defined in the template.\n *\n * Currently, the ngMessages module only contains the code for the `ngMessages`, `ngMessagesInclude`\n * `ngMessage` and `ngMessageExp` directives.\n *\n * ## Usage\n * The `ngMessages` directive allows keys in a key/value collection to be associated with a child element\n * (or 'message') that will show or hide based on the truthiness of that key's value in the collection. A common use\n * case for `ngMessages` is to display error messages for inputs using the `$error` object exposed by the\n * {@link ngModel ngModel} directive.\n *\n * The child elements of the `ngMessages` directive are matched to the collection keys by a `ngMessage` or\n * `ngMessageExp` directive. The value of these attributes must match a key in the collection that is provided by\n * the `ngMessages` directive.\n *\n * Consider the following example, which illustrates a typical use case of `ngMessages`. Within the form `myForm` we\n * have a text input named `myField` which is bound to the scope variable `field` using the {@link ngModel ngModel}\n * directive.\n *\n * The `myField` field is a required input of type `email` with a maximum length of 15 characters.\n *\n * ```html\n * <form name=\"myForm\">\n *   <label>\n *     Enter text:\n *     <input type=\"email\" ng-model=\"field\" name=\"myField\" required maxlength=\"15\" />\n *   </label>\n *   <div ng-messages=\"myForm.myField.$error\" role=\"alert\">\n *     <div ng-message=\"required\">Please enter a value for this field.</div>\n *     <div ng-message=\"email\">This field must be a valid email address.</div>\n *     <div ng-message=\"maxlength\">This field can be at most 15 characters long.</div>\n *   </div>\n * </form>\n * ```\n *\n * In order to show error messages corresponding to `myField` we first create an element with an `ngMessages` attribute\n * set to the `$error` object owned by the `myField` input in our `myForm` form.\n *\n * Within this element we then create separate elements for each of the possible errors that `myField` could have.\n * The `ngMessage` attribute is used to declare which element(s) will appear for which error - for example,\n * setting `ng-message=\"required\"` specifies that this particular element should be displayed when there\n * is no value present for the required field `myField` (because the key `required` will be `true` in the object\n * `myForm.myField.$error`).\n *\n * ### Message order\n *\n * By default, `ngMessages` will only display one message for a particular key/value collection at any time. If more\n * than one message (or error) key is currently true, then which message is shown is determined by the order of messages\n * in the HTML template code (messages declared first are prioritised). This mechanism means the developer does not have\n * to prioritize messages using custom JavaScript code.\n *\n * Given the following error object for our example (which informs us that the field `myField` currently has both the\n * `required` and `email` errors):\n *\n * ```javascript\n * <!-- keep in mind that ngModel automatically sets these error flags -->\n * myField.$error = { required : true, email: true, maxlength: false };\n * ```\n * The `required` message will be displayed to the user since it appears before the `email` message in the DOM.\n * Once the user types a single character, the `required` message will disappear (since the field now has a value)\n * but the `email` message will be visible because it is still applicable.\n *\n * ### Displaying multiple messages at the same time\n *\n * While `ngMessages` will by default only display one error element at a time, the `ng-messages-multiple` attribute can\n * be applied to the `ngMessages` container element to cause it to display all applicable error messages at once:\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- attribute-style usage -->\n * <div ng-messages=\"myForm.myField.$error\" ng-messages-multiple>...</div>\n *\n * <!-- element-style usage -->\n * <ng-messages for=\"myForm.myField.$error\" multiple>...</ng-messages>\n * ```\n *\n * ## Reusing and Overriding Messages\n * In addition to prioritization, ngMessages also allows for including messages from a remote or an inline\n * template. This allows for generic collection of messages to be reused across multiple parts of an\n * application.\n *\n * ```html\n * <script type=\"text/ng-template\" id=\"error-messages\">\n *   <div ng-message=\"required\">This field is required</div>\n *   <div ng-message=\"minlength\">This field is too short</div>\n * </script>\n *\n * <div ng-messages=\"myForm.myField.$error\" role=\"alert\">\n *   <div ng-messages-include=\"error-messages\"></div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * However, including generic messages may not be useful enough to match all input fields, therefore,\n * `ngMessages` provides the ability to override messages defined in the remote template by redefining\n * them within the directive container.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- a generic template of error messages known as \"my-custom-messages\" -->\n * <script type=\"text/ng-template\" id=\"my-custom-messages\">\n *   <div ng-message=\"required\">This field is required</div>\n *   <div ng-message=\"minlength\">This field is too short</div>\n * </script>\n *\n * <form name=\"myForm\">\n *   <label>\n *     Email address\n *     <input type=\"email\"\n *            id=\"email\"\n *            name=\"myEmail\"\n *            ng-model=\"email\"\n *            minlength=\"5\"\n *            required />\n *   </label>\n *   <!-- any ng-message elements that appear BEFORE the ng-messages-include will\n *        override the messages present in the ng-messages-include template -->\n *   <div ng-messages=\"myForm.myEmail.$error\" role=\"alert\">\n *     <!-- this required message has overridden the template message -->\n *     <div ng-message=\"required\">You did not enter your email address</div>\n *\n *     <!-- this is a brand new message and will appear last in the prioritization -->\n *     <div ng-message=\"email\">Your email address is invalid</div>\n *\n *     <!-- and here are the generic error messages -->\n *     <div ng-messages-include=\"my-custom-messages\"></div>\n *   </div>\n * </form>\n * ```\n *\n * In the example HTML code above the message that is set on required will override the corresponding\n * required message defined within the remote template. Therefore, with particular input fields (such\n * email addresses, date fields, autocomplete inputs, etc...), specialized error messages can be applied\n * while more generic messages can be used to handle other, more general input errors.\n *\n * ## Dynamic Messaging\n * ngMessages also supports using expressions to dynamically change key values. Using arrays and\n * repeaters to list messages is also supported. This means that the code below will be able to\n * fully adapt itself and display the appropriate message when any of the expression data changes:\n *\n * ```html\n * <form name=\"myForm\">\n *   <label>\n *     Email address\n *     <input type=\"email\"\n *            name=\"myEmail\"\n *            ng-model=\"email\"\n *            minlength=\"5\"\n *            required />\n *   </label>\n *   <div ng-messages=\"myForm.myEmail.$error\" role=\"alert\">\n *     <div ng-message=\"required\">You did not enter your email address</div>\n *     <div ng-repeat=\"errorMessage in errorMessages\">\n *       <!-- use ng-message-exp for a message whose key is given by an expression -->\n *       <div ng-message-exp=\"errorMessage.type\">{{ errorMessage.text }}</div>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </form>\n * ```\n *\n * The `errorMessage.type` expression can be a string value or it can be an array so\n * that multiple errors can be associated with a single error message:\n *\n * ```html\n *   <label>\n *     Email address\n *     <input type=\"email\"\n *            ng-model=\"data.email\"\n *            name=\"myEmail\"\n *            ng-minlength=\"5\"\n *            ng-maxlength=\"100\"\n *            required />\n *   </label>\n *   <div ng-messages=\"myForm.myEmail.$error\" role=\"alert\">\n *     <div ng-message-exp=\"'required'\">You did not enter your email address</div>\n *     <div ng-message-exp=\"['minlength', 'maxlength']\">\n *       Your email must be between 5 and 100 characters long\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * ```\n *\n * Feel free to use other structural directives such as ng-if and ng-switch to further control\n * what messages are active and when. Be careful, if you place ng-message on the same element\n * as these structural directives, Angular may not be able to determine if a message is active\n * or not. Therefore it is best to place the ng-message on a child element of the structural\n * directive.\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-messages=\"myForm.myEmail.$error\" role=\"alert\">\n *   <div ng-if=\"showRequiredError\">\n *     <div ng-message=\"required\">Please enter something</div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * ## Animations\n * If the `ngAnimate` module is active within the application then the `ngMessages`, `ngMessage` and\n * `ngMessageExp` directives will trigger animations whenever any messages are added and removed from\n * the DOM by the `ngMessages` directive.\n *\n * Whenever the `ngMessages` directive contains one or more visible messages then the `.ng-active` CSS\n * class will be added to the element. The `.ng-inactive` CSS class will be applied when there are no\n * messages present. Therefore, CSS transitions and keyframes as well as JavaScript animations can\n * hook into the animations whenever these classes are added/removed.\n *\n * Let's say that our HTML code for our messages container looks like so:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-messages=\"myMessages\" class=\"my-messages\" role=\"alert\">\n *   <div ng-message=\"alert\" class=\"some-message\">...</div>\n *   <div ng-message=\"fail\" class=\"some-message\">...</div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * Then the CSS animation code for the message container looks like so:\n *\n * ```css\n * .my-messages {\n *   transition:1s linear all;\n * }\n * .my-messages.ng-active {\n *   // messages are visible\n * }\n * .my-messages.ng-inactive {\n *   // messages are hidden\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Whenever an inner message is attached (becomes visible) or removed (becomes hidden) then the enter\n * and leave animation is triggered for each particular element bound to the `ngMessage` directive.\n *\n * Therefore, the CSS code for the inner messages looks like so:\n *\n * ```css\n * .some-message {\n *   transition:1s linear all;\n * }\n *\n * .some-message.ng-enter {}\n * .some-message.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {}\n *\n * .some-message.ng-leave {}\n * .some-message.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {}\n * ```\n *\n * {@link ngAnimate Click here} to learn how to use JavaScript animations or to learn more about ngAnimate.\n */\nangular.module('ngMessages', [], function initAngularHelpers() {\n  // Access helpers from angular core.\n  // Do it inside a `config` block to ensure `window.angular` is available.\n  forEach = angular.forEach;\n  isArray = angular.isArray;\n  isString = angular.isString;\n  jqLite = angular.element;\n})\n  .info({ angularVersion: '1.6.8' })\n\n  /**\n   * @ngdoc directive\n   * @module ngMessages\n   * @name ngMessages\n   * @restrict AE\n   *\n   * @description\n   * `ngMessages` is a directive that is designed to show and hide messages based on the state\n   * of a key/value object that it listens on.
